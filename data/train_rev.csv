What had showed up was a small vase with 4 short cut roses and some greens - table ornament, not really Valentine's Day flowers. 

In speaking with another friend, something similar happened to her - her fiancee had ordered a dozen of roses for her for Valentine's Day while he was in Germany as a surprise and they never showed up. So when he called them to complaint, they actually then called up my friend to confirm whether or not she had received the flowers. Which she didn't, so they said they would resend - only to have them deliver it to the wrong place.

one of my friends has dietary restrictions and needs to have gluten-free items. When I had called to make the dinner reservation, I had asked and the hostess said, yes, we do have gluten-free items that are not just salads. Just let the server know when you come in.

excited to find another gluten-free place in town, my friends and I show up for the reservation. Upon arrival, the server was really nice and friendly. When we had asked about the gluten-free options, the answer was unfortunately as we do not cook our foods separately, the only gluten-free items are salads. Which was a disppointment to us, as we had specifically asked if there were gluten-free items that weren't salads on the menu.

So we decided to just order a couple of apps and drinks as we have been sitting there for quite some time, and it wasn't the server's fault that there wasn't any gluten-free items (we felt bad to just get up and leave).

Surprisingly this place is pretty big to seat a big group of 12 and still have a few more small tables available.

However, the food was great and it accommodating for many different people - seafood lovers, vegans, etc.

Definitely recommend the basil fried rice and the fried sole fish with eggplant but for those curry lovers out there, stay away from the roti curry chicken - no curry taste, just coconut favour. But the Roti itself was really good.

Most of the dishes were under $10 - definitely a good deal!

Love that it has a nice indoor salt water pool for the doggies to use. It is small, and only meant for 1 dog at a time. I have a small little one that makes this size work well for him, but not sure how the bigger dogs can really swim in here.

The pool is great as the water is lukewarm so my little guy is willing to go in (as we have been to another indoor pool which the water is cold).

For the 1st time users, they have an instructor there to help assess what your dog can do or not do, that way you don't scared them off from swimming.

After that, you are free to book time for just you and your pup.

And they have a tub outside of the pool to bath them when they are done.

We happen to be in the plaza and saw this place for bubble tea, so we decided to grab a few to go.

First of all, the two menus is located in a very awkward place (one very high up on the wall and one in the corner also by the wall), set up is not really friendly neither can it accommodate a large group of people to look at the menu at the same time.

The menu items itself had different options than your typically bubble tea place. Their specialty are mousse drinks - which we had no idea what exactly it was. So when we asked the staff, they said it was some sort of cheese. 

For a Sunday afternoon, they were also out of grass jelly and pudding, which are ingredients in quite a few of their drinks (so not sure how that works).

The service is really bad, they don't understand English so when you asked them about the menu items, they can't really explain what they are.

We had ordered the following:
- slush mango (came with tapioca and mousse)
- peach ice tea
- roasted oolong milk tea
- supernova kumquat lemonade

And when we asked what the difference between a supernova kumquat lemonade under the galaxy drinks section (which are supposed to be layered drinks), and the kumquat lemonade, they said it had a layer of blue mousse - so we were like ok we will try it then. But what came was just a bigger cup size of the kumquat lemonade. When we asked them again, they said it was just a size difference, that's what makes it supernova - which is pretty dumb to me as on the menu both items had the same two size choices of regular or large. 

The mango slush and the roasted oolong milk tea wasn't bad. But the other two was not that great. The tea had a big floral taste that overpowered everything. There was no peach taste in the peach ice tea. The kumquat one had no kumquat taste and was just bitter from the lime and it tasted like it had no sugar in it at all.

I guess if you need a non-busy place to use WIFI and work, then this is the place, no one wants to come here.

Also - their gimmick also seems to be the lightbulb drinks, which were intriguing to us, but you are not allowed to take the lightbulb home...

It was definitely different and worth the wait. 

We started off with the House Cured Meat - it was good - but definitely too much for just 2 people to share (and no need to order the extra bread if it's only two people).

Next came the roasted bone marrow - which is amazing and definitely worth ordering. Had we not ordered so many other dishes, we would have ordered a second round of this. Who knew bone marrow could be this tasty!!

Then came the Spicy Horse Tartare, which we thought was intriguing, as we have never heard, so we had ordered it. When it showed up, it was like a salad. Wasn't bad, worth trying but probably only a one-time thing for us.

Tongue on Brioche is definitely another worth ordering. it is a sandwich that tasted like a Montreal smoked meat sandwich. SO GOOD that it melts in your mouth - so soft and tender. If it wasn't because we had ordered so much food and this was the last main course that showed up, we would have devoured it.

For dessert, we had ordered the Foie and Nutella, as we thought this was very interesting. It was good, but after 4 dishes already, this was just a little too rich. It came with banana bread that was really good.

the classic - 2 eggs any style, house cured bacon or sage and onion sausage, crispy griddled red skin potatoes with sea salt and thyme. Served with toast of your choice. Upgrade your toast to a buttermilk biscuit 

Emma's Benny - Warm and fluffy buttermilk biscuit topped with house cured peameal bacon, poached eggs and smothered in mousselline sauce. Served with a side of griddled red skin potatoes.

big portions - really good!

if you want the benny, make sure you asked them if they still have it as they tend to sell out quick - I had ordered the last one of the day!!!"	0	0	0	['omg', 'came', 'friend', 'brunch', 'woww', 'wait', 'min', 'tabl', 'later', 'day', 'look', 'menu', 'want', 'tri', 'everyth', 'french', 'toast', 'strawberri', 'shortcakesdonut', 'sold', 'time', 'got', 'therebut', 'wind', 'order', 'two', 'thing', 'classic', 'egg', 'style', 'hous', 'cure', 'bacon', 'sage', 'onion', 'sausag', 'crispi', 'griddl', 'red', 'skin', 'potato', 'sea', 'salt', 'thyme', 'serv', 'toast', 'choic', 'upgrad', 'toast', 'buttermilk', 'biscuit', 'emma', 'benni', 'warm', 'fluffi', 'buttermilk', 'biscuit', 'top', 'hous', 'cure', 'peameal', 'bacon', 'poach', 'egg', 'smother', 'moussellin', 'sauc', 'serv', 'side', 'griddl', 'red', 'skin', 'potatoesbig', 'portion', 'realli', 'goodif', 'want', 'benni', 'make', 'sure', 'ask', 'still', 'tend', 'sell', 'quick', 'order', 'last', 'one', 'day']

The cookies were $1.75 a piece, average for the size of the cookie. However they are the crunchy kind of cookies so if you are looking for a soft chewy cookie, you should skip it.

Overall not bad, will be back to try other stuff! Can't wait until she adds more gluten free items on the menu!"	2	0	1	['read', 'bakeri', 'blogto', 'decid', 'check', 'sinc', 'closecut', 'littl', 'place', 'mid', 'chinatownsmelt', 'amaz', 'walk', 'walk', 'follow', 'carrot', 'cake', 'ginger', 'spice', 'cooki', 'spici', 'chocol', 'cooki', 'gluten', 'free', 'peanut', 'butter', 'cookieth', 'mini', 'inch', 'cake', 'good', 'size', 'overli', 'price', 'bit', 'sweet', 'side', 'wasnt', 'terribl', 'make', 'sure', 'tea', 'coffe', 'sugarth', 'cooki', 'piec', 'averag', 'size', 'cooki', 'howev', 'crunchi', 'kind', 'cooki', 'look', 'soft', 'chewi', 'cooki', 'skip', 'itoveral', 'bad', 'back', 'tri', 'stuff', 'cant', 'wait', 'add', 'gluten', 'free', 'item', 'menu']

the way the system works is that it is a combo:

- soup base option (no MSG fish soup or Chicken soup base)
- two toppings are included with additional toppings at $1.75 each
- types of noodles
- 1 hot drink is included but other options have an additional charge

Then you also have an option of adding side items.

I had ordered the parsley and century egg fish soup with fish filet, fish tofu, cabbage and flat rice noodles. Not sure if it is due to the type of noodles i had picked but i found it a little lacky in flavour.

It had just opened when I started going and I walked in off the street because I figured I'd take a chance, it looked clean and it was close to home. 
I was greeted by the owner, a pleasant Chinese woman, who did my nails that day. Since then, I've been back at least once a month for manicures and pedicures. Those are the only things I've had done, but I would suspect that the other services are pretty good as well. 
The spa is new and everything is spacious and clean. They have massaging chairs for pedicures and the prices are reasonable. 
It's a basic nail place, so the bells and whistles are not numerous, but that suits me fine because it keeps the price down, allows for walk-ins and gets you in and out pretty quickly. 
Some of the ladies in the salon do a better job than others, but no one does a bad job. I have had plenty of bad manicures before, so I know what a bad job looks like. Just don't go expecting someone to fuss over you, or give you plenty of conversation. English is not the first language and I have never felt the need to force conversation. 
In this past year I have noticed a huge increase in the number of people that go to this spa, so they seem to be doing quite well. I have never had to wait more than ten minutes for service though and I'm happier they are busy because it means they are doing well and will stay in business. Good for them AND for me! 
Some of the services they give include manicures, pedicures, gel nails, waxing, threading, eyebrow tinting and ear candles."	15	1	5	['start', 'go', 'nail', 'salon', 'last', 'summer', 'almost', 'year', 'open', 'start', 'go', 'walk', 'street', 'figur', 'id', 'take', 'chanc', 'look', 'clean', 'close', 'home', 'greet', 'owner', 'pleasant', 'chines', 'woman', 'nail', 'day', 'sinc', 'ive', 'back', 'least', 'month', 'manicur', 'pedicur', 'thing', 'ive', 'done', 'would', 'suspect', 'servic', 'pretti', 'good', 'well', 'spa', 'new', 'everyth', 'spaciou', 'clean', 'massag', 'chair', 'pedicur', 'price', 'reason', 'basic', 'nail', 'place', 'bell', 'whistl', 'numer', 'suit', 'fine', 'keep', 'price', 'allow', 'walkin', 'get', 'pretti', 'quickli', 'ladi', 'salon', 'better', 'job', 'other', 'one', 'bad', 'job', 'plenti', 'bad', 'manicur', 'know', 'bad', 'job', 'look', 'like', 'dont', 'go', 'expect', 'someon', 'fuss', 'give', 'plenti', 'convers', 'english', 'first', 'languag', 'never', 'felt', 'need', 'forc', 'convers', 'past', 'year', 'notic', 'huge', 'increas', 'number', 'peopl', 'go', 'spa', 'seem', 'quit', 'well', 'never', 'wait', 'ten', 'minut', 'servic', 'though', 'im', 'happier', 'busi', 'mean', 'well', 'stay', 'busi', 'good', 'servic', 'give', 'includ', 'manicur', 'pedicur', 'gel', 'nail', 'wax', 'thread', 'eyebrow', 'tint', 'ear', 'candl']

I have gotten burritos and other things from this place on several occasions and it's always been sub-par. Bland food, overcooked, sometimes burnt (nachos). As a result, I haven't bothered going or ordering from there in well over a year. Well, today I had a craving for Mexican and since Toronto has a huge lack of Mexican restaurant choices and because I'm busy working at home, my husband and myself decided to order from BarBurrito's delivery. I should also mention that if you go to justeat.ca BarBurrito charges $7 delivery. Orderit.ca has no charge. Don't know if that's the ordering website or the restaurant, but it's a tip for anyone who decides to order from this place.

So I went ahead and placed the order...only to have it be ""rejected"" by BarBurrito, because they are busy right now. This restaurant is listed on two different food ordering sites, but they won't deliver if they don't feel inclined?? SERIOUSLY! 

So I have learned my lesson. Don't give places second, or even third chances. And this place...don't even give it a first chance.

My expectations of a breakfast place are cheap prices, good food (because eggs are hard to mess up), fast turnover and service. This place has prices on the high end of breakfast place, on weekends they are very crowded and it will take some time to be seated and the food is alright. 

The last time I went, I was with my husband and we went in the door to a huge crowd. There was no wait to be seated sign, but we guessed correctly and waited. Problem is that you pay and wait in the same place, which meant people were coming and going in a very small area. It was chaos for awhile. Finally we were seated outside at a picnic table and told that other people may be seated with us at the table, because they lacked space. 

The waitress took some time to arrive and by then we were ready to give our order. I ordered eggs and bacon and toast. We also each ordered fruit smoothies. I asked for mine without banana. The waitress came back a few minutes later and said with a straight face, ""The guys back there put like three bananas in your smoothie!"" 

It took me a minute to realize she was joking....heh....

We played several rounds of Scrabble on an iphone because the food was taking quite awhile and it finally came out. Our drinks were no where to be seen. We had to ask twice for them. By then we were almost done the food!

The food was alright, but I usually go to places like Egg Smart and for the cost, they give you way more food, for a better price and honestly, I think it tastes way better. These famous ""Boom frites"" are just thick, cut potatoes and they give you one slice of toast! 

Anyway, if you're in the area and really want some breakfast, it's not terrible, but I think you can do way better! 

Oh, and I disagree that it's a good place for a group. Unless you want to wait forever...or make a group by joining another couple at their picnic table!"	2	0	1	['think', 'may', 'let', 'place', 'rave', 'review', 'fact', 'ive', 'eaten', 'twice', 'neither', 'time', 'spectacular', 'expect', 'breakfast', 'place', 'cheap', 'price', 'good', 'food', 'egg', 'hard', 'mess', 'fast', 'turnov', 'servic', 'place', 'price', 'high', 'end', 'breakfast', 'place', 'weekend', 'crowd', 'take', 'time', 'seat', 'food', 'alright', 'last', 'time', 'went', 'husband', 'went', 'door', 'huge', 'crowd', 'wait', 'seat', 'sign', 'guess', 'correctli', 'wait', 'problem', 'pay', 'wait', 'place', 'meant', 'peopl', 'come', 'go', 'small', 'area', 'chao', 'awhil', 'final', 'seat', 'outsid', 'picnic', 'tabl', 'told', 'peopl', 'may', 'seat', 'us', 'tabl', 'lack', 'space', 'waitress', 'took', 'time', 'arriv', 'readi', 'give', 'order', 'order', 'egg', 'bacon', 'toast', 'also', 'order', 'fruit', 'smoothi', 'ask', 'mine', 'without', 'banana', 'waitress', 'came', 'back', 'minut', 'later', 'said', 'straight', 'face', 'guy', 'back', 'put', 'like', 'three', 'banana', 'smoothi', 'took', 'minut', 'realiz', 'jokinghehw', 'play', 'sever', 'round', 'scrabbl', 'iphon', 'food', 'take', 'quit', 'awhil', 'final', 'came', 'drink', 'seen', 'ask', 'twice', 'almost', 'done', 'foodth', 'food', 'alright', 'usual', 'go', 'place', 'like', 'egg', 'smart', 'cost', 'give', 'way', 'food', 'better', 'price', 'honestli', 'think', 'tast', 'way', 'better', 'famou', 'boom', 'frite', 'thick', 'cut', 'potato', 'give', 'one', 'slice', 'toast', 'anyway', 'your', 'area', 'realli', 'want', 'breakfast', 'terribl', 'think', 'way', 'better', 'oh', 'disagre', 'good', 'place', 'group', 'unless', 'want', 'wait', 'foreveror', 'make', 'group', 'join', 'anoth', 'coupl', 'picnic', 'tabl']

I have been dying to try out an actual poutinerie for a long time and it did not disappoint. I've been twice now. Once I had the basic poutine and once I had the pulled pork poutine. Both are good, but I really love that pulled pork poutine. The BBQ sauce they have has just a touch of sweetness and it really compliments the fries and cheese curds. A large poutine is more than enough for two people and I liked the little restaurant space with the 80s glam rock playing and quirky pictures on the walls. I guess my only criticism is that they need more seating. Both times I've been we got lucky and managed to snag seats as someone was leaving, but it's gross out on the street and this summer anyway, it's been SO hot outside. They don't have space for more seats, so this isn't really something they can easily fix, but maybe something to keep in mind for future establishments?

Angela continued doing a fine job, but it was always the same. Very busy and always a bit sloppy. For example, no one ever put colour protector around my head, so you'd always end up with dye all over your skin and ears. They would send you home with some dye remover wrapped in tin foil, to wipe it away. This sort of stuff can be overlooked if the job is excellent, but it was always just good. Finally, I decided to see if I couldn't do better elsewhere.

The meat is bland and often dry and overcooked, served with rice and a salad (generic lettuce with ranch dressing-type stuff) and their naan tastes like cardboard. The rest of the stuff is edible, but the naan is just plain atrocious. I have had Afghani food in other locations and it's flavourful and delicious. This does not hold up.

A few years ago, Sheppard Centre was an alright place. When I lived at Yonge and Sheppard, there was a grocery store across the street and all the basics you would need st Sheppard Centre and it was good. 

Sheppard Centre is at a major subway stop, in a hugely busy area, but somehow stores keep failing here. 

That being the case, there are a few stores that are nice and handy. I would consider this mall for errands, now that I live away...except that the major reason for coming is gone now.

Sheppard Centre used to have 1 hour of free parking, which is a huge draw. You could go and park, run in and pick up your mail, or something from Shoppers Drug Mart and be on your way. They got rid of that. Not only that, but it's $3.50 for half an hour or under!

I think this is pretty pathetic for a crappy mall. 

""OH, but they have to pay for their excellent staff!"" you say?

Yeah, let me tell you about the staff that work there. First of all, you should also know that the ticket machine to pay for your parking tickets likes to break down ALL THE TIME, so you have to go to the parking garage and drive up to the ticket booth, park in the non-parking spots, block traffic and go in and pay the guys sitting around in the office...an office with TV screens of the parking garage, where our car has been broken into before...but it's not their fault. There are SIGNS that say they are not liable. Soooo...what are the TV screens for? To WATCH peoples' cars get broken into and laugh?

Right, so back to the story! 

Before I knew what to do when the machines broke down, I went to the in-mall security\/info booth to ask. The guy was behind the booth, on the phone, having a personal conversation. He saw me, but turned away and continued for ten minutes. Finally he got off the phone and made like he was coming over...only to turn away at the last second and start going through some papers. Finally I called out and said, ""Excuse me?"" He told me he was busy and made a point of moving towards me as slowly as possible.

This isn't the only time a staff member has been rude to me before. Dogs are allowed in the subway, so I was walking through once, to the subway entrance, HOLDING my dog, in my arms and a security guard chased me down to tell me dogs are not allowed. I told him I was just heading to the subway, so he followed me there to make sure. Yeah, because I really wanted to take my dog to the dollarstore and was clearly lying. GO STOP PEOPLE FROM BREAKING INTO CARS! 

Bayview Village, down the street, or one subway stop over, has a Shoppers, a grocery store, a post office, a Blacks photography and clothing stores...like Sheppard Centre. It also has a Chapters with a Starbucks, an LCBO, GOOD restaurants and the people there are polite, the bathrooms nicer than mine at home AND parking is free.

So basically Sheppard Centre can bite me. I'm done with them."	11	10	3	['whole', 'place', 'basic', 'suck', 'even', 'wors', 'mani', 'bad', 'experi', 'place', 'need', 'give', 'year', 'ago', 'sheppard', 'centr', 'alright', 'place', 'live', 'yong', 'sheppard', 'groceri', 'store', 'across', 'street', 'basic', 'would', 'need', 'st', 'sheppard', 'centr', 'good', 'sheppard', 'centr', 'major', 'subway', 'stop', 'huge', 'busi', 'area', 'somehow', 'store', 'keep', 'fail', 'case', 'store', 'nice', 'handi', 'would', 'consid', 'mall', 'errand', 'live', 'awayexcept', 'major', 'reason', 'come', 'gone', 'nowsheppard', 'centr', 'use', 'hour', 'free', 'park', 'huge', 'draw', 'could', 'go', 'park', 'run', 'pick', 'mail', 'someth', 'shopper', 'drug', 'mart', 'way', 'got', 'rid', 'half', 'hour', 'underi', 'think', 'pretti', 'pathet', 'crappi', 'mall', 'oh', 'pay', 'excel', 'staff', 'sayyeah', 'let', 'tell', 'staff', 'work', 'first', 'also', 'know', 'ticket', 'machin', 'pay', 'park', 'ticket', 'like', 'break', 'time', 'go', 'park', 'garag', 'drive', 'ticket', 'booth', 'park', 'nonpark', 'spot', 'block', 'traffic', 'go', 'pay', 'guy', 'sit', 'around', 'officean', 'offic', 'tv', 'screen', 'park', 'garag', 'car', 'broken', 'beforebut', 'fault', 'sign', 'say', 'liabl', 'soooowhat', 'tv', 'screen', 'watch', 'peopl', 'car', 'get', 'broken', 'laughright', 'back', 'stori', 'knew', 'machin', 'broke', 'went', 'inmal', 'securityinfo', 'booth', 'ask', 'guy', 'behind', 'booth', 'phone', 'person', 'convers', 'saw', 'turn', 'away', 'continu', 'ten', 'minut', 'final', 'got', 'phone', 'made', 'like', 'come', 'overonli', 'turn', 'away', 'last', 'second', 'start', 'go', 'paper', 'final', 'call', 'said', 'excus', 'told', 'busi', 'made', 'point', 'move', 'toward', 'slowli', 'possiblethi', 'isnt', 'time', 'staff', 'member', 'rude', 'dog', 'allow', 'subway', 'walk', 'subway', 'entranc', 'hold', 'dog', 'arm', 'secur', 'guard', 'chase', 'tell', 'dog', 'allow', 'told', 'head', 'subway', 'follow', 'make', 'sure', 'yeah', 'realli', 'want', 'take', 'dog', 'dollarstor', 'clearli', 'lie', 'go', 'stop', 'peopl', 'break', 'car', 'bayview', 'villag', 'street', 'one', 'subway', 'stop', 'shopper', 'groceri', 'store', 'post', 'offic', 'black', 'photographi', 'cloth', 'storeslik', 'sheppard', 'centr', 'also', 'chapter', 'starbuck', 'lcbo', 'good', 'restaur', 'peopl', 'polit', 'bathroom', 'nicer', 'mine', 'home', 'park', 'freeso', 'basic', 'sheppard', 'centr', 'bite', 'im', 'done']

We booked a trip through gate1travel.com and when you are booking they give you the options for hotels. The default booking is for Circus Circus, NOT Circus, Circus Manor Motor Lodge. It says three stars and even says this on gate1's travel site: ""The rooms are fitted with contemporary decor and furnishings. All rooms are equipped with amenities that will be sure to make your stay pleasant, such as internet access (surcharge), a hair dryer, and a television with cable channels.""
We looked up Circus Circus, saw it was nothing special, but alright and went for it...and found out that in fact, we were in the Manor Motor Lodge.
Now, I KNOW that this is gate1's fault and I'll be taking it up with them as well. Also, I want to point out that on my second night, I complained and they put us in a suite for the night, so this is nothing against the overall hotel, but there are still a few things people need to know staying here.
Rooms: They are DUMPS in the manor motor lodge. I asked, when we were checking in, if those rooms had been redone at all and was told that ""all the rooms have been updated in SOME way""...well I don't know what way this room had been updated. The carpets were worn and stained. The bedding was the polyester crap from the 80s. The wallpaper was stained and peeling off the walls. The bathroom floor had cracks in the tile and a permanent grunge that could never been cleaned. It looked like a motel room you see in horror movies!
The hallways were constantly loud and smelled of marijuana, with cheap, apple air freshener over top, which was interesting because of the number of small children running around with distinctly trashy families. I even made a joke with a cab driver in Las Vegas, that we were NOT ugly enough to be staying in this hotel. He agreed and said it was the butt of the joke of cabbies on the strip. Good to know.

Hotel: The hotel amenities are geared towards children, but are basically a money grab. There is a small, indoor amusement park that costs something like $8\/30 second ride. There are shops and restaurants, but non are high end. We ate at three places while there and overall they were crappy. I'll give those individual ratings though.

Service: This was very good actually. I had a very pleasant bell hop help us out and all the wait staff and cleaning staff were very nice and the woman whom I complained to was very receptive and polite, so that earns them an extra star.

The thing with the hotel is that even these rooms we were stuck in, fall under 3 stars, even though they, by themselves, would barely qualify as 1 star rooms, because the whole hotel falls under one heading.

SO, lesson to be learned, these rooms are NOT nice rooms. The hotel is considerably crappier than other hotels. It's also quite far from the main strip. BUT it is cheap. If you are (for whatever God-awful reason) bringing children to Vegas, I guess this would fit the bill. Otherwise, if you're just looking for a bed and a cheap one, this also fits the bill.

We went here on a Saturday night. It's literally a block away from where we live and we have somehow never been. We finally decided to go for it!

The atmosphere is fine. It's nice and clean and much larger than you would realize from the outside. The decor it a bit cheesy with faux Roman sculptures. 

Service was very good. The waiter was quick with our drinks and food and was helpful with suggestions. 

Now to the food. My husband ordered the veal parm and I ordered a pasta with chicken. We ordered brushetta as a starter. I noticed from the menu that, while a lot of selection, many of the pasta dishes were a bit uninspired. A lot of very basic dishes. Pasta with mushrooms and red sauce, or pasta with shrimp and pesto, etc. I really enjoy creative combinations and flavours when I go to an Italian restaurant, because quite honestly, I can make the basic stuff at home...for a hell of a lot cheaper.

That said, the pasta dishes were solid, if nothing special. My pasta was well cooked, but the chicken tasted like something you would find in a McDonald's salad and the mushrooms were good, but that was the basis of the dish. My husband's was basic, but veal parms usually are. He did note that there was a LOT of sauce on his. There was, but I like that personally, if there is bread to dip into it...but no bread was served to our table, other than the bread from our brushetta. 

The brushetta wasn't great. The tomato mixture on top was good, but the bread wasn't properly toasted, so it got soggy and couldn't hold its shape. It kept falling apart when you picked it up. 

The desserts really brought this place back for me. I had their homemade creme brule and it was really excellent. On the menu it tells you which are made in-house and I would highly recommend getting one of those. 

Overall, it was quite expensive for pretty basic Italian food, so it didn't stun me. I'm not opposed to going back, but it's not my first choice. My major reason for going back will be for convenience, because it is so close to us."	0	0	0	['ok', 'sort', 'perfect', 'descript', 'place', 'fineit', 'greatw', 'went', 'saturday', 'night', 'liter', 'block', 'away', 'live', 'somehow', 'never', 'final', 'decid', 'go', 'itth', 'atmospher', 'fine', 'nice', 'clean', 'much', 'larger', 'would', 'realiz', 'outsid', 'decor', 'bit', 'cheesi', 'faux', 'roman', 'sculptur', 'servic', 'good', 'waiter', 'quick', 'drink', 'food', 'help', 'suggest', 'food', 'husband', 'order', 'veal', 'parm', 'order', 'pasta', 'chicken', 'order', 'brushetta', 'starter', 'notic', 'menu', 'lot', 'select', 'mani', 'pasta', 'dish', 'bit', 'uninspir', 'lot', 'basic', 'dish', 'pasta', 'mushroom', 'red', 'sauc', 'pasta', 'shrimp', 'pesto', 'etc', 'realli', 'enjoy', 'creativ', 'combin', 'flavour', 'go', 'italian', 'restaur', 'quit', 'honestli', 'make', 'basic', 'stuff', 'homefor', 'hell', 'lot', 'cheaperthat', 'said', 'pasta', 'dish', 'solid', 'noth', 'special', 'pasta', 'well', 'cook', 'chicken', 'tast', 'like', 'someth', 'would', 'find', 'mcdonald', 'salad', 'mushroom', 'good', 'basi', 'dish', 'husband', 'basic', 'veal', 'parm', 'usual', 'note', 'lot', 'sauc', 'like', 'person', 'bread', 'dip', 'itbut', 'bread', 'serv', 'tabl', 'bread', 'brushetta', 'brushetta', 'wasnt', 'great', 'tomato', 'mixtur', 'top', 'good', 'bread', 'wasnt', 'properli', 'toast', 'got', 'soggi', 'couldnt', 'hold', 'shape', 'kept', 'fall', 'apart', 'pick', 'dessert', 'realli', 'brought', 'place', 'back', 'homemad', 'creme', 'brule', 'realli', 'excel', 'menu', 'tell', 'made', 'inhous', 'would', 'highli', 'recommend', 'get', 'one', 'overal', 'quit', 'expens', 'pretti', 'basic', 'italian', 'food', 'didnt', 'stun', 'im', 'oppos', 'go', 'back', 'first', 'choic', 'major', 'reason', 'go', 'back', 'conveni', 'close', 'us']

The gelato was good, but certainly wasn't the best I've had. It was much more akin to ice cream and the flavour selection wasn't huge. 

That said, they have some interesting flavours. I personally tried Twix and birthday cake and they were both very good. The more traditional flavour I tried (creme caramel) was a little boring and lacked flavour. 

My husband had the strawberry, Skor and chocolate. All fine, none blew me away.

Okay, so the gelato is good, if not the ""best""! But perhaps that's being picky. If I'm in the area and want some dessert, this place is great and I can imagine in the summer it's fantastic.

So why the three stars?? First of all you can only get gelato in two sizes - regular and large. There is no small option and both of those options are quite large. If you only want a taste of gelato, there is no option for you! 

Secondly, although this place is named for it's gelato, it also specializes in cupcakes. We got a cupcake to bring home. When asked if we would like it packaged to bring home we said yes...and they threw it in a bag. The girl apologized and said they had nothing appropriate to package it in. Why did you offer then?? But furthermore, YES YOU DO! You literally have perfectly shaped round cups to put gelato in everywhere! Guess what shape cupcakes are??

Oh well, no biggie.

So, since this place is about the gelato and the cupcakes, you may be interested in the cupcakes...well the taste was overall good, but it was a very oily cupcake. The icing especially. The cake was moist, which is good...except it was SO moist the cake was just falling apart everywhere! 

So what's the final synopsis. This place isn't bad. It has some delicious options. But nothing is perfect and in fact there are a number of flaws, which prevent me from giving it a better score. We'll see how I feel if it's a boiling hot summer day and I go in there for gelato though...I may be singing a different tune!"	2	0	0	['want', 'someth', 'sweet', 'dessert', 'dinner', 'made', 'way', 'place', 'boast', 'best', 'gelato', 'toronto', 'gelato', 'good', 'certainli', 'wasnt', 'best', 'ive', 'much', 'akin', 'ice', 'cream', 'flavour', 'select', 'wasnt', 'huge', 'said', 'interest', 'flavour', 'person', 'tri', 'twix', 'birthday', 'cake', 'good', 'tradit', 'flavour', 'tri', 'creme', 'caramel', 'littl', 'bore', 'lack', 'flavour', 'husband', 'strawberri', 'skor', 'chocol', 'fine', 'none', 'blew', 'awayokay', 'gelato', 'good', 'best', 'perhap', 'that', 'picki', 'im', 'area', 'want', 'dessert', 'place', 'great', 'imagin', 'summer', 'fantasticso', 'three', 'star', 'first', 'get', 'gelato', 'two', 'size', 'regular', 'larg', 'small', 'option', 'option', 'quit', 'larg', 'want', 'tast', 'gelato', 'option', 'secondli', 'although', 'place', 'name', 'gelato', 'also', 'special', 'cupcak', 'got', 'cupcak', 'bring', 'home', 'ask', 'would', 'like', 'packag', 'bring', 'home', 'said', 'yesand', 'threw', 'bag', 'girl', 'apolog', 'said', 'noth', 'appropri', 'packag', 'offer', 'furthermor', 'ye', 'liter', 'perfectli', 'shape', 'round', 'cup', 'put', 'gelato', 'everywher', 'guess', 'shape', 'cupcak', 'areoh', 'well', 'biggieso', 'sinc', 'place', 'gelato', 'cupcak', 'may', 'interest', 'cupcakeswel', 'tast', 'overal', 'good', 'oili', 'cupcak', 'ice', 'especi', 'cake', 'moist', 'goodexcept', 'moist', 'cake', 'fall', 'apart', 'everywher', 'what', 'final', 'synopsi', 'place', 'isnt', 'bad', 'delici', 'option', 'noth', 'perfect', 'fact', 'number', 'flaw', 'prevent', 'give', 'better', 'score', 'well', 'see', 'feel', 'boil', 'hot', 'summer', 'day', 'go', 'gelato', 'thoughi', 'may', 'sing', 'differ', 'tune']

I purchased a charm from Pandora and it was put directly onto the bracelet. Overnight, I reconsidered one of the charms and wanted to exchange it. I brought it back, with the receipt, but was informed that I couldn't exchange it, because it was on the bracelet. 
I explained that it had been put there BY an employee. The manager was brought out and she was immediately snarky and rude towards me. She said she wouldn't accept a charm that was ""all worn and beat up"". I encouraged her to look at the charm. She could clearly see it was in pristine condition. She glanced at my bracelet as a whole, but did not look at the charm, instead insisting that she could tell.

Seriously lady, you don't stand by your product at all? Your jewellery is so crappy it just gets beaten up and looks like crap after being worn for probably an hour total?!? This wasn't even my fault!!! Plus, she could clearly see from my bracelet that I had spent a LOT of money on my bracelet and am a loyal customer. 

I know that if I had gotten a Pandora box and put the charm in it and brought it back, they would have exchanged it without a problem. I can't now, because I'm sure I would be recognized. Instead I'll go to another location...where perhaps I'll be treated like a valued customer and not a leper. 

I've had bad experiences at this location before. The employees here seem to think customers are beneath them. Each location is independently owned, so needless to say I won't purchase from this location again. Anyone who wants to purchase from Pandora I encourage you to check out the Scarborough or Fairview Mall locations. Always had good experiences at those locations. 

Instead I have sent a complaining email to Pandora head office. We'll see what they respond with."	4	0	0	['pandora', 'charm', 'great', 'locat', 'purchas', 'charm', 'pandora', 'put', 'directli', 'onto', 'bracelet', 'overnight', 'reconsid', 'one', 'charm', 'want', 'exchang', 'brought', 'back', 'receipt', 'inform', 'couldnt', 'exchang', 'bracelet', 'explain', 'put', 'employe', 'manag', 'brought', 'immedi', 'snarki', 'rude', 'toward', 'said', 'wouldnt', 'accept', 'charm', 'worn', 'beat', 'encourag', 'look', 'charm', 'could', 'clearli', 'see', 'pristin', 'condit', 'glanc', 'bracelet', 'whole', 'look', 'charm', 'instead', 'insist', 'could', 'tellseri', 'ladi', 'dont', 'stand', 'product', 'jewelleri', 'crappi', 'get', 'beaten', 'look', 'like', 'crap', 'worn', 'probabl', 'hour', 'total', 'wasnt', 'even', 'fault', 'plu', 'could', 'clearli', 'see', 'bracelet', 'spent', 'lot', 'money', 'bracelet', 'loyal', 'custom', 'know', 'gotten', 'pandora', 'box', 'put', 'charm', 'brought', 'back', 'would', 'exchang', 'without', 'problem', 'cant', 'im', 'sure', 'would', 'recogn', 'instead', 'ill', 'go', 'anoth', 'locationwher', 'perhap', 'ill', 'treat', 'like', 'valu', 'custom', 'leper', 'ive', 'bad', 'experi', 'locat', 'employe', 'seem', 'think', 'custom', 'beneath', 'locat', 'independ', 'own', 'needless', 'say', 'wont', 'purchas', 'locat', 'anyon', 'want', 'purchas', 'pandora', 'encourag', 'check', 'scarborough', 'fairview', 'mall', 'locat', 'alway', 'good', 'experi', 'locat', 'instead', 'sent', 'complain', 'email', 'pandora', 'head', 'offic', 'well', 'see', 'respond']

The pork was pure fat and while it wasn't gristly, it was SO greasy, the grease positively dripped all over your hands. It was hugely unappetizing. I couldn't taste the cucumbers and didn't see any evidence of scallions. It was basically just pure fat, wrapped in a bland ""bun"". So I guess if you enjoy really fatty, greasy appetizers, this is the right deal. (Really, I can't stress enough how fatty the pork was...it was purely, white, greasy fat! Either change the name of the dish to pork fat buns, or please add some actual pork!)

The noodles however, were quite good and I liked the flavour combinations. I had the dan dan noodles, which is spicy pork, dried scallops and peanuts. I enjoyed that you could really taste the peanuts. I was a little disappointed that the pork was ground pork, instead of shredded pork. It made the dish seem cheaper and less inspired. 

I liked the atmosphere, but the seating is at long tables and so you share the space with whoever they place next to you. The seats are long benches, so if you're in the middle of the bench, you have to lift your leg over...I saw guys struggling to do this...now imagine being a girl, wearing a skirt and having to do this. No graceful way to go about that!

To be honest, this place just didn't blow me away enough to make a conscious effort to return. It certainly wasn't terrible, but it wasn't really good either."	2	1	0	['realli', 'enjoy', 'noodl', 'signatur', 'pork', 'bun', 'seem', 'someth', 'everyon', 'order', 'rave', 'like', 'pork', 'pure', 'fat', 'wasnt', 'gristli', 'greasi', 'greas', 'posit', 'drip', 'hand', 'huge', 'unappet', 'couldnt', 'tast', 'cucumb', 'didnt', 'see', 'evid', 'scallion', 'basic', 'pure', 'fat', 'wrap', 'bland', 'bun', 'guess', 'enjoy', 'realli', 'fatti', 'greasi', 'appet', 'right', 'deal', 'realli', 'cant', 'stress', 'enough', 'fatti', 'pork', 'wasit', 'pure', 'white', 'greasi', 'fat', 'either', 'chang', 'name', 'dish', 'pork', 'fat', 'bun', 'pleas', 'add', 'actual', 'porkth', 'noodl', 'howev', 'quit', 'good', 'like', 'flavour', 'combin', 'dan', 'dan', 'noodl', 'spici', 'pork', 'dri', 'scallop', 'peanut', 'enjoy', 'could', 'realli', 'tast', 'peanut', 'littl', 'disappoint', 'pork', 'ground', 'pork', 'instead', 'shred', 'pork', 'made', 'dish', 'seem', 'cheaper', 'less', 'inspir', 'like', 'atmospher', 'seat', 'long', 'tabl', 'share', 'space', 'whoever', 'place', 'next', 'seat', 'long', 'bench', 'your', 'middl', 'bench', 'lift', 'leg', 'overi', 'saw', 'guy', 'struggl', 'thisnow', 'imagin', 'girl', 'wear', 'skirt', 'grace', 'way', 'go', 'thatto', 'honest', 'place', 'didnt', 'blow', 'away', 'enough', 'make', 'consciou', 'effort', 'return', 'certainli', 'wasnt', 'terribl', 'wasnt', 'realli', 'good', 'either']

Almost every one in our party either didn't see it initially (it's sort of nondescript looking), or weren't sure which door\/staircase was the proper one to get inside. 
Once inside though, it's an eclectic blend of vintage meets white-washed industrial. If you didn't know that was a style, neither did I, but it totally works. There was a great blend of music in the background...it was a mix, probably an employee just made it, but it was great mood music. I want that mix CD! 
My brother had called several weeks ago to make a reservation and somehow they didn't have it. Apparently it's an answering service for reservations and they say they call you back if they can't accommodate you. He never received a call back, so the assumption was that the reservation was alright. Unfortunately, as I said, there was no reservation. The staff apologized profusely though and luckily there was space and they set up a table for us right away. 
We ordered from the drink menu and I will say that they drinks are very expensive. The wine is what you would expect and the mixed drink (at least the one I had, the Smith Lemonade) was fantastic, but it was also $12, which is steep even for Toronto bar standards. 
As I said, we ordered from the Summerlicious menu. I have heard many comments online that people are feeling disillusioned with Summerlicious because so many restaurants give you the cheapest options and it's not worth the cost. This was NOT the case with Smith at all. There were several great options to choose from and the food was excellent. I had the curried carrot soup, which was spicy but great. Every one else in my party also enjoyed their various appetizers. My main course was a Georgian Bay whitefish, which was done perfectly, just crispy enough on the outside and flaky on the inside. The pork chops were also raved about. There was also a risotto, which two of the three people who ordered it really enjoyed. You can't take that last guy (brother again) too seriously, since he's a very picky eater. 
The desserts were all good, however the fudge ice cream, is really just chocolate ice cream, nothing special. The lemon curd tasted like lemon pie filling and was delicious and the bread pudding was heavenly! Seriously, it was SO good. 
I think everyone left feeling really satisfied. 
It did take a long time to get the food. This wasn't a problem for us, since we were there to converse and I understand that great food may take some time, but if you are really hungry, or looking for a quicker meal, this isn't the right choice.
Basically it lost of star because of the lost reservation and lack of visibility from the street. Also, we weren't thrilled with the washrooms. Besides the fact that they are co-ed, which is a little weird, there is one, large sink and a foot peddle to operate it. Since only one person can step on it at a time, you have to wait for that person to finish, before you can wash your hands, which starts to cause a bit of a back-up if more than two people are in the washroom. Also, the hand dryers were weak\/not working. 
That said, I wouldn't let a slightly annoying bathroom stop me from coming here! This is a nice, little place!"	1	0	1	['book', 'reserv', 'smith', 'summerlici', 'one', 'major', 'problem', 'find', 'though', 'almost', 'everi', 'one', 'parti', 'either', 'didnt', 'see', 'initi', 'sort', 'nondescript', 'look', 'werent', 'sure', 'doorstaircas', 'proper', 'one', 'get', 'insid', 'insid', 'though', 'eclect', 'blend', 'vintag', 'meet', 'whitewash', 'industri', 'didnt', 'know', 'style', 'neither', 'total', 'work', 'great', 'blend', 'music', 'backgroundit', 'mix', 'probabl', 'employe', 'made', 'great', 'mood', 'music', 'want', 'mix', 'cd', 'brother', 'call', 'sever', 'week', 'ago', 'make', 'reserv', 'somehow', 'didnt', 'appar', 'answer', 'servic', 'reserv', 'say', 'call', 'back', 'cant', 'accommod', 'never', 'receiv', 'call', 'back', 'assumpt', 'reserv', 'alright', 'unfortun', 'said', 'reserv', 'staff', 'apolog', 'profus', 'though', 'luckili', 'space', 'set', 'tabl', 'us', 'right', 'away', 'order', 'drink', 'menu', 'say', 'drink', 'expens', 'wine', 'would', 'expect', 'mix', 'drink', 'least', 'one', 'smith', 'lemonad', 'fantast', 'also', 'steep', 'even', 'toronto', 'bar', 'standard', 'said', 'order', 'summerlici', 'menu', 'heard', 'mani', 'comment', 'onlin', 'peopl', 'feel', 'disillus', 'summerlici', 'mani', 'restaur', 'give', 'cheapest', 'option', 'worth', 'cost', 'case', 'smith', 'sever', 'great', 'option', 'choos', 'food', 'excel', 'curri', 'carrot', 'soup', 'spici', 'great', 'everi', 'one', 'els', 'parti', 'also', 'enjoy', 'variou', 'appet', 'main', 'cours', 'georgian', 'bay', 'whitefish', 'done', 'perfectli', 'crispi', 'enough', 'outsid', 'flaki', 'insid', 'pork', 'chop', 'also', 'rave', 'also', 'risotto', 'two', 'three', 'peopl', 'order', 'realli', 'enjoy', 'cant', 'take', 'last', 'guy', 'brother', 'serious', 'sinc', 'he', 'picki', 'eater', 'dessert', 'good', 'howev', 'fudg', 'ice', 'cream', 'realli', 'chocol', 'ice', 'cream', 'noth', 'special', 'lemon', 'curd', 'tast', 'like', 'lemon', 'pie', 'fill', 'delici', 'bread', 'pud', 'heavenli', 'serious', 'good', 'think', 'everyon', 'left', 'feel', 'realli', 'satisfi', 'take', 'long', 'time', 'get', 'food', 'wasnt', 'problem', 'us', 'sinc', 'convers', 'understand', 'great', 'food', 'may', 'take', 'time', 'realli', 'hungri', 'look', 'quicker', 'meal', 'isnt', 'right', 'choicebas', 'lost', 'star', 'lost', 'reserv', 'lack', 'visibl', 'street', 'also', 'werent', 'thrill', 'washroom', 'besid', 'fact', 'co', 'littl', 'weird', 'one', 'larg', 'sink', 'foot', 'peddl', 'oper', 'sinc', 'one', 'person', 'step', 'time', 'wait', 'person', 'finish', 'wash', 'hand', 'start', 'caus', 'bit', 'backup', 'two', 'peopl', 'washroom', 'also', 'hand', 'dryer', 'weaknot', 'work', 'said', 'wouldnt', 'let', 'slightli', 'annoy', 'bathroom', 'stop', 'come', 'nice', 'littl', 'place']

It also gives you cravings...often for food you can't possibly get, because they're making some crazy thing across the country that you cannot possibly find a duplicate for. 

Naturally I got a crazy craving for fish and chips...my mistake being that this was a Sunday and for whatever reason, no fish and chip places are open on Sunday. 

I did a lot of looking around, before I found this place, which wasn't too far away and was, most importantly, open! 

This is a quirky place, with wood panelling on the walls and some random fish hung around the place.

Fry's boasts full day breakfasts and the fish and chips. I saw plenty of people coming for the full day breakfasts, which are decently priced and looked pretty good, if nothing special.

We came for the F&Cs though! 

We ordered the single piece, which was MORE than enough food. Quite expensive though. You're looking at around $15\/meal of one large piece of fish and some fries.

It was good, but it wasn't great. Worst of all, the tartar sauce came in sealed packages....ugh.

I'm sorry, but when I'm paying a premium for my fish and chips, at a place named after it's Fish and Chips...I WANT SOME DAMN PROPER TARTAR SAUCE! It's only like the EASIEST thing in the world to make.

Service was fine. No complaints. The waitress did her job...took our order, gave us our food and gave us the bill....that was her job and she did no more and no less.

The restaurant ambiance wasn't there, the food wasn't special and the prices weren't good.

I came again, with my family, for my birthday, at the beginning of October. Even though we had a reservation, our table wasn't ready. We were finally seated and the waiter introduced himself...and then disappeared. Came back ten minutes later and took drink orders and then disappeared for 15 minutes...this continued the entire time. Our dinner took A LONG time. It took forever for our drinks to be served and even longer for our food to come out. Then when the food came out, we got two plates and then waited five minutes for one more plate...then waited another five minutes for another plate. It took our group 15 minutes just for us all to receive the food! Obviously we couldn't eat until everyone had been served and the food was getting cold at that point.

Oh, the best part?? Someone mentioned it was my birthday and the waiter said, ""Oh, so you're a January baby,"" indicating to when I was conceived...to my parents. Yes...thank you sir. I would really like to be reminded of my parents' doing it, right before dinner...because that's completely appropriate. 

So yes, the service this time was TERRIBLE! 

BUT, everyone enjoyed their food and thought it was really good, so there ya have it.

We went in and looked at the selection and decided what we wanted and when the person behind the counter asked to take our order and we said we wanted to sit down. He wouldn't take the order and instead had us sit down and look at menus. We explained we knew what we wanted already, but he said he'd be back in a minute. This was fine, we weren't in a rush, but we were both a little confused by the ten minutes we sat there waiting for him. 
When he finally came out, as we were ordering, his cell phone rang and he took the call and walked away, around the corner of the building. We waited for about five minutes for him to finish his call and he finally took our order. Umm...that was some pretty shocking un-professionalism, but we laughed it off and ordered. 

I ordered basic New York cheesecake and my friend ordered an apple cheesecake. Cheesecakes were good, (she really liked her) and we ordered cappuccino and a flavored San Pellegrino and they were good and big sizes, but my cheesecake was a bit frozen in the middle. Knowing it wasn't fresh sort of took away from the experience. 
Anyway, we had a fine time here and the desserts are good, but not great. It was the service that was most disappointing.

First of all, I find that this location seems to be sold out of things less often than others. This is an overall problem with the Sephoras in this city - they sell out of things and don't restock often enough. 
One of Sephora's policies is that if you are, at any time, unhappy or unsatisfied with a product, you can return or exchange it.
I bought a cream eyeliner from this Sephora several months ago and used about half of it before it decided to dry out (even though I had been keeping the lid on it). I took it back actually because I was hoping there might be some cream or something I could add, that would make it creamy again. 
No need! They offered to give me a new one, or exchange mine. I chose exchange and they gave me a new brand that they said was excellent AND said they would mention the problem to the sales rep that was coming in for that brand next week. Not that I expect big things to come from that per say, but I'm happy they didn't just blow it off!
My only problem with Sephora (all of them) is that you need to make an appointment in advance to get makeup put on and you are required to spend a certain amount of money, while every other makeup seller does this service for free and accommodates walk-ins. I just hear people asking about it a lot and I had a party to go to one night and was downtown and wanted someone to help me touch up my makeup (without doing it myself using samples in the store) and they were very reluctant to help.

I think the burgers here are heads and tails above many other gourmet burger places, mainly because the diversity of toppings. 

I like the fries here, but they're nothing special. Same with the poutine, same with the onion rings (I;ve tried em all). But those burgers are good! No word of a lie!

I think the prices are pretty standard for these types of burger places and service has always been fine for me.

They have a great coke machine...which I know sounds super weird, but you choose your drink...and then can choose the flavour. For example...if I want Fanta, I select that and can then choose any number of Fanta flavours. I always go with a diet cherry coke...where else does that even exist in Canada???! (I'll tell you actually. You can get that at Licks, but they get really confused when you ask for diet coke, instead of regular...they make it themselves). 

Criticisms of the small location are valid. This place is very small and cramped. Not nice to eat in...or even to wait. But it is what it is. They have a mounted flat screen for people to watch and they've done what can can in a super small space."	1	0	0	['poor', 'hero', 'burger', 'get', 'lot', 'flack', 'peopl', 'ive', 'never', 'anyth', 'good', 'experi', 'think', 'burger', 'head', 'tail', 'mani', 'gourmet', 'burger', 'place', 'mainli', 'divers', 'top', 'like', 'fri', 'theyr', 'noth', 'special', 'poutin', 'onion', 'ring', 'ive', 'tri', 'em', 'burger', 'good', 'word', 'liei', 'think', 'price', 'pretti', 'standard', 'type', 'burger', 'place', 'servic', 'alway', 'fine', 'methey', 'great', 'coke', 'machinewhich', 'know', 'sound', 'super', 'weird', 'choos', 'drinkand', 'choos', 'flavour', 'exampleif', 'want', 'fanta', 'select', 'choos', 'number', 'fanta', 'flavour', 'alway', 'go', 'diet', 'cherri', 'cokewher', 'els', 'even', 'exist', 'canada', 'ill', 'tell', 'actual', 'get', 'lick', 'get', 'realli', 'confus', 'ask', 'diet', 'coke', 'instead', 'regularthey', 'make', 'critic', 'small', 'locat', 'valid', 'place', 'small', 'cramp', 'nice', 'eat', 'inor', 'even', 'wait', 'mount', 'flat', 'screen', 'peopl', 'watch', 'theyv', 'done', 'super', 'small', 'space']

Both times I have gone because my normal waxer has been MIA and this place is conveniently close. That said, I find it very expensive, especially for what you get. The first time I went I got the works done...legs, bikini, underarms, etc. The person doing the waxing was very pleasant and kept the conversation going, which I appreciated, but I was still red for DAYS, something I have rarely experienced before in years of waxing. That said, she got the job done. 
Today, however, I had a different girl, who was also very pleasant, but it wasn't until I got home, that I realized what a shoddy job she had done. Patches of hair are still there. I pretty much have to get this redone and I had to pay more to go to this place than any other place I've been to + tip! 
Not only that, but the facility for waxing is pretty pitiful. It's a VERY small room, with the ""bed"" pushed up against a wall. When I went in the summer it was very warm, so I'm not sure if there are A\/C or not. The other wall is entirely windows, which of course always have the blinds closed. It's a weirdly appointed room for a waxing area. Perhaps it was originally a storage closet? With windows?? I don't know, but it's not as though you're going here and paying more because the atmosphere is so much nicer!

There is ONE waitress who works the entire restaurant. The service is hugely lacking as a result.

Last time I went, they had half price appetizers. We were told that they couldn't separate the bill and she brought us one large bill....oh, but SHE couldn't subtract the half price from our apps, because she needed the manager, who wasn't there to do it. So she found DIFFERENT items, that were the same cost as the half price items we got and made the bill with them....well how in hell are we supposed to divide up our bill, based on items we didn't order????!? It was actually shockingly stupid. 

We all guessed as best we could and threw in cash...I for one threw in the towel too. The food continues to be subpar at best, the prices are not great, even with half price and the service is horrendously terrible.

I reserved a table on the Wednesday before and I'm glad I did, but even still we were originally seats in a less than ideal table. I spoke to the hostess and a manager came out and graciously moved us, which was very nice of them, because apparently many people call and reserve specific seats! 

I have walked by this restaurant a million times and never known it was there. It is directly on Bloor, but in a small ""mall"" which houses The Japanese Foundation and some other businesses. The restaurant is on the second floor and there are no readily visible signs on the street, so you would never think to just walk into this place...maybe that's the point! 

The decor of the restaurant is really lovely. They have a huge, stain glass ceiling and dark wooden furniture and Art Nouveau decor. The bathrooms are large, individually sectioned off stall, with white and black tiles everywhere and large, vintage, French ads on the walls. 

Two of our party ordered from the Winterlicious menu, one ordered from the regular menu and I ordered from their regular Prix Fixe menu, which they have available all the time and is $7 more than the Winterlicious. 

They were also offering some Winterlicious cocktails...I had three (the same one) and they were excellent. 

Our appetizers included two salads, which looked great and (according to the orderes) were. My husband ordered the onion soup from the Winterlicious menu and it was great and I ordered the mushroom soup from the prix fixe and it was excellent!

The main courses included steak from the regular menu, which were ordered with steak frites. The steak was a nice cut of meat, prepared exactly as asked and the steak frites were served with a garlic aioli (which we all tried) and was really good!

The lasagna and pork belly were ordered from the Winterlicious menu. Lasagna came in a rounded dish, where it had been baked and was on the smaller side, but satisfying within a three course meal. My husband had the pork belly from the Winterlicious menu and I tried that. The sauce on it and the tenderness of the pork were really nice. 

I had the pistachio chicken, which was a huge dish! The chicken breast was served on top of another cut of chicken, but in dark meat. Both had pistachios on top and delicious sauces drizzled along the bottom of the plate and a few apple slices as garnish. I couldn't finish two pieces of chicken and I stuck mostly with the white meat, but it was a nice option to have to two and I tried the dark and it was really excellent as well! 

The reason I chose the prix fixe menu over the Winterlicious, was because of the dessert. The Winterlicious had the pistachio chicken as a main and the onion soup was an option for the appetizer, but the desserts set the prix fixe apart. On the Winterlicious menu the option was a rhubarb crumble, or chocolate mousse. Neither of which I really cared for, although I tried it from my husband and it was good. On the prix fixe menu you have a choice of creme brule (which I have heard good things about) and a sticky toffee cake. I asked the waitress what she recommended and she said the sticky toffee, because it was such a lovely, winter dessert. I had been set on the creme brule, but you know what....brules are a dime a dozen. How many places have sticky, toffee cake? 

I was NOT disappointed. The cake was amazing! It was a small, singular bundt cake, topped with a toffee crisp and a small scoop of caramel ice cream and surrounded on the plate with warm, caramel. It was decadent and delicious. 

Finally I'll mention that our server was lovely and attentive and not a single person in our party were disappointed in any way. We all left very happy and satisfied. 

This place is a little on the pricier end (would have been less so except for the three drinks myself and my friend had and the beers that the guys had), but it's great for a nice night out, or a romantic date. 

I will definitely come back some time in the future."	1	0	1	['went', 'husband', 'anoth', 'coupl', 'start', 'doubl', 'date', 'night', 'reserv', 'tabl', 'wednesday', 'im', 'glad', 'even', 'still', 'origin', 'seat', 'less', 'ideal', 'tabl', 'spoke', 'hostess', 'manag', 'came', 'gracious', 'move', 'us', 'nice', 'appar', 'mani', 'peopl', 'call', 'reserv', 'specif', 'seat', 'walk', 'restaur', 'million', 'time', 'never', 'known', 'directli', 'bloor', 'small', 'mall', 'hous', 'japanes', 'foundat', 'busi', 'restaur', 'second', 'floor', 'readili', 'visibl', 'sign', 'street', 'would', 'never', 'think', 'walk', 'placemayb', 'that', 'point', 'decor', 'restaur', 'realli', 'love', 'huge', 'stain', 'glass', 'ceil', 'dark', 'wooden', 'furnitur', 'art', 'nouveau', 'decor', 'bathroom', 'larg', 'individu', 'section', 'stall', 'white', 'black', 'tile', 'everywher', 'larg', 'vintag', 'french', 'ad', 'wall', 'two', 'parti', 'order', 'winterlici', 'menu', 'one', 'order', 'regular', 'menu', 'order', 'regular', 'prix', 'fix', 'menu', 'avail', 'time', 'winterlici', 'also', 'offer', 'winterlici', 'cocktailsi', 'three', 'one', 'excel', 'appet', 'includ', 'two', 'salad', 'look', 'great', 'accord', 'order', 'husband', 'order', 'onion', 'soup', 'winterlici', 'menu', 'great', 'order', 'mushroom', 'soup', 'prix', 'fix', 'excellentth', 'main', 'cours', 'includ', 'steak', 'regular', 'menu', 'order', 'steak', 'frite', 'steak', 'nice', 'cut', 'meat', 'prepar', 'exactli', 'ask', 'steak', 'frite', 'serv', 'garlic', 'aioli', 'tri', 'realli', 'goodth', 'lasagna', 'pork', 'belli', 'order', 'winterlici', 'menu', 'lasagna', 'came', 'round', 'dish', 'bake', 'smaller', 'side', 'satisfi', 'within', 'three', 'cours', 'meal', 'husband', 'pork', 'belli', 'winterlici', 'menu', 'tri', 'sauc', 'tender', 'pork', 'realli', 'nice', 'pistachio', 'chicken', 'huge', 'dish', 'chicken', 'breast', 'serv', 'top', 'anoth', 'cut', 'chicken', 'dark', 'meat', 'pistachio', 'top', 'delici', 'sauc', 'drizzl', 'along', 'bottom', 'plate', 'appl', 'slice', 'garnish', 'couldnt', 'finish', 'two', 'piec', 'chicken', 'stuck', 'mostli', 'white', 'meat', 'nice', 'option', 'two', 'tri', 'dark', 'realli', 'excel', 'well', 'reason', 'chose', 'prix', 'fix', 'menu', 'winterlici', 'dessert', 'winterlici', 'pistachio', 'chicken', 'main', 'onion', 'soup', 'option', 'appet', 'dessert', 'set', 'prix', 'fix', 'apart', 'winterlici', 'menu', 'option', 'rhubarb', 'crumbl', 'chocol', 'mouss', 'neither', 'realli', 'care', 'although', 'tri', 'husband', 'good', 'prix', 'fix', 'menu', 'choic', 'creme', 'brule', 'heard', 'good', 'thing', 'sticki', 'toffe', 'cake', 'ask', 'waitress', 'recommend', 'said', 'sticki', 'toffe', 'love', 'winter', 'dessert', 'set', 'creme', 'brule', 'know', 'whatbrul', 'dime', 'dozen', 'mani', 'place', 'sticki', 'toffe', 'cake', 'disappoint', 'cake', 'amaz', 'small', 'singular', 'bundt', 'cake', 'top', 'toffe', 'crisp', 'small', 'scoop', 'caramel', 'ice', 'cream', 'surround', 'plate', 'warm', 'caramel', 'decad', 'delici', 'final', 'ill', 'mention', 'server', 'love', 'attent', 'singl', 'person', 'parti', 'disappoint', 'way', 'left', 'happi', 'satisfi', 'place', 'littl', 'pricier', 'end', 'would', 'less', 'except', 'three', 'drink', 'friend', 'beer', 'guy', 'great', 'nice', 'night', 'romant', 'date', 'definit', 'come', 'back', 'time', 'futur']

I took a school group there. FYI for only $1\/person you can book a tour and the gallery theatres will be yours exclusively. We were not so on top of things and just showed up with 35 kids. Luckily, they were really accommodating and we split the kids into two groups to watch The Clock. Worked out really well and the kids really liked it.

I went with a bunch of friends from work. Some of the friends has heard that this place KNOWS their wine and ordered a bottle of chianti, which was great (and I'm not a huge wine drinker). 
The ladies I was with ordered two caesar salads to share amongst the four of them and the waitress brought them out the salads already split on individual plates, garnished with a garlic bread crouton. I don't think the salads were anything special, but I find that caesar salads in general aren't, so peoples' complaints about them below seem largely unfounded. 
I ordered the baked goat cheese appetizer...OMG it was SO good. Goat cheese and grilled veggies on top of a portobello mushroom cap, with some sort of sauce and with salad and shredded carrots and balsamic reduction....to DIE for. 
For my main I ordered the Penne Gorgonzola, which was also fabulous! The members of my partied ordered the veal parmesan (but grilled veggies instead of the pasta), the salmon with a lobster brandy cream sauce, a NY striploin and fettucine and everyone loved their food. One woman I was with IS a chef, so I feel like that was saying something. 
Now, since I didn't taste their dishes, I can only expand on my own. The sauce was to DIE for. Creamy, complex and delicious. The pairing of veggies with prosciutto and cheese was excellent. I would order that dish again in a heartbeat! 
Since we were having a good time and the food had met our expectations, we went for it and ordered dessert (even though we were all stuffed). We all ordered the white chocolate creme br√ªl√©e, except one friend who ordered the tiramisu and were once again not disappointed. Our creme br√ªl√©es were crackly on the outside and creamy on the inside. Perfect! The tiramisu was apparently great, served very untraditionally in a large plate, with an indentation like a bowl in the middle. 
I was also pleased to find out that they serve caffeine-free cappuccinos, so we all ordered those as well and it was served with a little almond biscotti and was great!

Altogether my meal came to $50 (tip included), which I think is more than I would spend on a normal dinner out, but not crazy. Also note though that I did not pay for the wine and did not order any other drinks. That would obviously have increased the price. 

The restaurant atmosphere is nothing special, but I'm disenchanted with the trendy spaces and pretentiously presented food that isn't half as good, so this wasn't a concern for me. The restaurant was clean and comfy, but the furniture was a little on the older side (like the dining chairs you would see in your fussy grandmother's home) and fake paintings on the walls.   

The service was excellent. Our waitress saw to our every need, answered all our questions and came over to chat and make sure we were happy and comfortable regularly. 

So, was it perfect? Well as I said, the salad was probably just average and the atmosphere also just average, but those did not pose major problems. I would ultimately give this place 4-1\/2, but since I can't and this leaned more to the good than anything remotely bad, it gets a 5! I would go back in a heartbeat!"	2	0	0	['surpris', 'see', 'neg', 'review', 'place', 'good', 'experi', 'went', 'bunch', 'friend', 'work', 'friend', 'heard', 'place', 'know', 'wine', 'order', 'bottl', 'chianti', 'great', 'im', 'huge', 'wine', 'drinker', 'ladi', 'order', 'two', 'caesar', 'salad', 'share', 'amongst', 'four', 'waitress', 'brought', 'salad', 'alreadi', 'split', 'individu', 'plate', 'garnish', 'garlic', 'bread', 'crouton', 'dont', 'think', 'salad', 'anyth', 'special', 'find', 'caesar', 'salad', 'gener', 'arent', 'peopl', 'complaint', 'seem', 'larg', 'unfound', 'order', 'bake', 'goat', 'chees', 'appetizeromg', 'good', 'goat', 'chees', 'grill', 'veggi', 'top', 'portobello', 'mushroom', 'cap', 'sort', 'sauc', 'salad', 'shred', 'carrot', 'balsam', 'reductionto', 'die', 'main', 'order', 'penn', 'gorgonzola', 'also', 'fabul', 'member', 'parti', 'order', 'veal', 'parmesan', 'grill', 'veggi', 'instead', 'pasta', 'salmon', 'lobster', 'brandi', 'cream', 'sauc', 'ny', 'striploin', 'fettucin', 'everyon', 'love', 'food', 'one', 'woman', 'chef', 'feel', 'like', 'say', 'someth', 'sinc', 'didnt', 'tast', 'dish', 'expand', 'sauc', 'die', 'creami', 'complex', 'delici', 'pair', 'veggi', 'prosciutto', 'chees', 'excel', 'would', 'order', 'dish', 'heartbeat', 'sinc', 'good', 'time', 'food', 'met', 'expect', 'went', 'order', 'dessert', 'even', 'though', 'stuf', 'order', 'white', 'chocol', 'creme', 'brle', 'except', 'one', 'friend', 'order', 'tiramisu', 'disappoint', 'creme', 'brle', 'crackli', 'outsid', 'creami', 'insid', 'perfect', 'tiramisu', 'appar', 'great', 'serv', 'untradit', 'larg', 'plate', 'indent', 'like', 'bowl', 'middl', 'also', 'pleas', 'find', 'serv', 'caffeinefre', 'cappuccino', 'order', 'well', 'serv', 'littl', 'almond', 'biscotti', 'greataltogeth', 'meal', 'came', 'tip', 'includ', 'think', 'would', 'spend', 'normal', 'dinner', 'crazi', 'also', 'note', 'though', 'pay', 'wine', 'order', 'drink', 'would', 'obvious', 'increas', 'price', 'restaur', 'atmospher', 'noth', 'special', 'im', 'disench', 'trendi', 'space', 'pretenti', 'present', 'food', 'isnt', 'half', 'good', 'wasnt', 'concern', 'restaur', 'clean', 'comfi', 'furnitur', 'littl', 'older', 'side', 'like', 'dine', 'chair', 'would', 'see', 'fussi', 'grandmoth', 'home', 'fake', 'paint', 'wall', 'servic', 'excel', 'waitress', 'saw', 'everi', 'need', 'answer', 'question', 'came', 'chat', 'make', 'sure', 'happi', 'comfort', 'regularli', 'perfect', 'well', 'said', 'salad', 'probabl', 'averag', 'atmospher', 'also', 'averag', 'pose', 'major', 'problem', 'would', 'ultim', 'give', 'place', 'sinc', 'cant', 'lean', 'good', 'anyth', 'remot', 'bad', 'get', 'would', 'go', 'back', 'heartbeat']

I'll start by saying that the hostess and our server were both lovely and they're really what earned the single star, because they were sweet, but the food was just horrible.

I ordered a simple grilled cheese sandwich. I asked the server if it was processed cheese, or ""real"" cheese in the sandwich and he had no idea what I was talking about. I tried to clarify by saying, ""Is it like Kraft single slices, or deli cheese?"" He said it was ""good"". This really should have been a sign and I could probably fault the waiter for this, since you SHOULD know what you're serving, but he was so sweet, I couldn't be mad!

My husband ordered a hot dog of sorts.

I asked if there was a way to substitute fries for a salad. There was not, but the server hooked me up and brought me a salad anyway (no charge). I asked for sweet potato fries with the sandwich.

Of course, my sandwich was made with plasticy, processed cheese, that was melted to the point of Cheeze-Wiz and was inedible. I took one bite of the sandwich and couldn't do another. I got regular fries, instead of sweet potato (didn't bother complaining, because I got the free salad, so whatever...like I said, nice server!) My husband's food was fine, although nothing special. They were good with the refills of our drinks.

Anyway, as nice as the servers were, it wasn't good.

We were told though that it was first come, first served, in terms of having the ideal seats by the windows that overlook the fountains of the Bellagio and The Strip.
We went for lunch though, so it wasn't too busy. We were seated by the window and were promptly served some sort of puffed rolls, with cheese and herbs infused. They were delicious!

We ordered the onion soup to start and I ordered parmesan chicken and my husband ordered a lamb burger. Our food came and was delicious. The soup was probably my favorite part. We were feeling very full by the end and so declined dessert, but were still given some jellies and chocolate truffle and then were served a small chocolate mousse, on a decorated plate that said Happy Anniversary, which was a total surprise (they had asked when I booked if it was a special occasion, but had said nothing while we were there).

I had been there before to get my nails done and the first time was quite good, but the second time was a hot mess. It looked like a five year old did my nails for me. I went home and took the polish off. But this is the kicker:
I couldn't get an appointment for highlights at my regular salon and this was close by, so I decided to give it a try (obviously the nail girl wouldn't be doing my hair). I went in and sat down the a woman with an Eastern European accent  came to talk with me. I showed her a picture of what I wanted and she showed me various hair dye samples....none of which looked like my picture, but I always assume the hair dressers know what's best. Now, you're all thinking, ""..and she did a poor job and you hated the colour..."" right? 
Nope, she told me she couldn't do my hair because I had lice! Of course I freaked out. Another hair dresser came over to see if I was alright and I was mortified. She asked if I had experienced any itching. I said no. This hairdresser turned back to the original hairdresser and asked if maybe it wasn't too bad yet, but original hairdresser said it was really, really bad. I freaked out and left (obviously without having anything done) and went to a Shoppers and bought lice shampoo. I went home and had my husband look at my hair. He looked and looked and could find nothing. I still didn't want to take chances, so we tore the house apart and washed and bagged everything and I went to a walk-in clinic. The doctor looked at my head and ALSO said there was nothing there! 
Since I was paranoid, I still used the shampoo and anytime my head itched in the slightest I went to examine it. But even with my husband and mother looking at my head, we never found a single thing. We didn't even see dandruff!! I went to a hairdresser a week later and they told me my hair was beautiful...but dry at the ends...yeah, because of the chemical-filled lice shampoo! Thanks a lot you crazy woman!
So ultimately, I never had lice. I don't know if this woman just decided she didn't feel like doing my hair, or if she was delusional, but I sure won't be going back there EVER again.

I was in Scarborough Town Centre and came upon this kiosk. It's not a storefront, but a rather ingenious booth, with colourful signs and a glass showcase full of cupcakes. 

There is a long list of flavours and I suspect (as with many places) they make different cupcakes for different days. 

I ordered 6, which was $18...I know, it's steep, that's pretty standard. Cupcake places seem to range from around the $2.25 mark to around $4\/cupcake. So these guys fall somewhere inbetween. But not cheap, so I expect excellence, needless to say.

Now, here's the strange thing. On their website each cupcake is listed as $2.90....was this the case at the store?? I sure hope not. Why would you have to pay MORE for buying more? Maybe it's an ordering online thing? Anyway, my GUESS is that you're paying $3\/cupcake at the store, or $18 for 6. No real incentive to buy 6. But I did, so moving on....

Of course I chose a range of flavours: oreo cookie. chocolate with vanilla icing, salted caramel, lemon and a double chocolate. 

Over two days we managed to work our way through them (myself and my husband) and I nibbled the different flavours. Lemon was my favorite, by far, with the salted caramel being a huge disappointment. It was entirely too salty. More salt than caramel. It wasn't very good at all.

But that said, none of the cupcakes really blew me away. AND in fact, they were VERY stale the next day, despite being stored in an airtight container, in the fridge. Luckily, the cold buttercream frosting was easy to scoop off and once they had been in the oven for a few minutes, they softened up a bit. 

The bottoms of the cupcakes stuck to the wrappers and the flavours were dull tasting and uninspired. 

I was also surprised at the lack of creativity in terms of Christmas flavours or designed. Right before Christmas you would expect some special flavours...maybe a candy cane, or gingerbread cupcake. It would be so easy to switch out one flavour and try to get people to consider your product for a Christmas party dessert. 

Having a little kiosk in a mall is a smart idea. Sadly, this business is not one I think I will bother with again!"	2	0	0	['love', 'cupcak', 'seriouslylov', 'affair', 'im', 'alway', 'lookout', 'new', 'cupcak', 'place', 'scarborough', 'town', 'centr', 'came', 'upon', 'kiosk', 'storefront', 'rather', 'ingeni', 'booth', 'colour', 'sign', 'glass', 'showcas', 'full', 'cupcak', 'long', 'list', 'flavour', 'suspect', 'mani', 'place', 'make', 'differ', 'cupcak', 'differ', 'day', 'order', 'know', 'steep', 'that', 'pretti', 'standard', 'cupcak', 'place', 'seem', 'rang', 'around', 'mark', 'around', 'cupcak', 'guy', 'fall', 'somewher', 'inbetween', 'cheap', 'expect', 'excel', 'needless', 'saynow', 'here', 'strang', 'thing', 'websit', 'cupcak', 'list', 'case', 'store', 'sure', 'hope', 'would', 'pay', 'buy', 'mayb', 'order', 'onlin', 'thing', 'anyway', 'guess', 'your', 'pay', 'cupcak', 'store', 'real', 'incent', 'buy', 'move', 'onof', 'cours', 'chose', 'rang', 'flavour', 'oreo', 'cooki', 'chocol', 'vanilla', 'ice', 'salt', 'caramel', 'lemon', 'doubl', 'chocol', 'two', 'day', 'manag', 'work', 'way', 'husband', 'nibbl', 'differ', 'flavour', 'lemon', 'favorit', 'far', 'salt', 'caramel', 'huge', 'disappoint', 'entir', 'salti', 'salt', 'caramel', 'wasnt', 'good', 'allbut', 'said', 'none', 'cupcak', 'realli', 'blew', 'away', 'fact', 'stale', 'next', 'day', 'despit', 'store', 'airtight', 'contain', 'fridg', 'luckili', 'cold', 'buttercream', 'frost', 'easi', 'scoop', 'oven', 'minut', 'soften', 'bit', 'bottom', 'cupcak', 'stuck', 'wrapper', 'flavour', 'dull', 'tast', 'uninspir', 'also', 'surpris', 'lack', 'creativ', 'term', 'christma', 'flavour', 'design', 'right', 'christma', 'would', 'expect', 'special', 'flavoursmayb', 'candi', 'cane', 'gingerbread', 'cupcak', 'would', 'easi', 'switch', 'one', 'flavour', 'tri', 'get', 'peopl', 'consid', 'product', 'christma', 'parti', 'dessert', 'littl', 'kiosk', 'mall', 'smart', 'idea', 'sadli', 'busi', 'one', 'think', 'bother']

Yelp) to figure out what we could do, because there is a very real lack of good Mexican food in Toronto. This place had some good reviews and wasn't too far away from us, so off we went.

Parking in Leaside can be pretty brutal, but we finally found a space and luckily, street parking is free. 

The restaurant is tacky, stereotypical, but cozy and we were quickly greeted and seated. 

The menu has basic Mexican fare, burritos, fajitas, tacos, with your choice of meat. Nothing too outside of the box, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. 

We ordered the guacamole to start and I ordered a chicken enchilada and my husband ordered the chimichanga. 

The guacamole is very delicious and creamy, but we had to ask for more nachos and even then it felt like not enough. We were really loading up the chips with the guacamole! 

The food came out and the was served with rice, a salad (sort of Italian dressing with feta and tomatoes) and refried beans. The salad was pretty generic and the rice was bland, but the actual main courses were great and the refried beans helped with the spice (I'm a wimp). 

The appetizer and our main courses came to $30 and we were VERY full.

I was running errands and hadn't eaten the whole day, so decided to finally give this place a shot. I ordered a chicken sandwich and iced tea.

The iced tea doesn't appear to be iced tea. It was a dark reddish colour and tasted like very watered down pomegranate juice. It was inedible. It was super gross. I was thinking that maybe they made a mistake, but I can't see on the menu anything else it might be and the girl who took my order, poured the drink and gave it to me SAID it was iced tea. Sooooo ew. 

Sandwich was alright, but just alright. The ""aroma sauce"" which is a garlic mayo of sorts was good and the roasted red peppers and mozzerella on the sandwich were good. The bread was good, but the chicken was the sort of cheap, crappy chicken you find at Subway, where it's a sort of compressed chicken-like white meat, with fake grill marks on it. It had no taste and really took away from the overall sandwich. 

There are soups, salads and of course hot beverages served at this place as well, so I'm not writing it off just yet, but this was not a good first impression."	0	0	0	['never', 'eaten', 'place', 'alway', 'crowd', 'decid', 'must', 'mean', 'someth', 'run', 'errand', 'hadnt', 'eaten', 'whole', 'day', 'decid', 'final', 'give', 'place', 'shot', 'order', 'chicken', 'sandwich', 'ice', 'teath', 'ice', 'tea', 'doesnt', 'appear', 'ice', 'tea', 'dark', 'reddish', 'colour', 'tast', 'like', 'water', 'pomegran', 'juic', 'ined', 'super', 'gross', 'think', 'mayb', 'made', 'mistak', 'cant', 'see', 'menu', 'anyth', 'els', 'might', 'girl', 'took', 'order', 'pour', 'drink', 'gave', 'said', 'ice', 'tea', 'sooooo', 'ew', 'sandwich', 'alright', 'alright', 'aroma', 'sauc', 'garlic', 'mayo', 'sort', 'good', 'roast', 'red', 'pepper', 'mozzerella', 'sandwich', 'good', 'bread', 'good', 'chicken', 'sort', 'cheap', 'crappi', 'chicken', 'find', 'subway', 'sort', 'compress', 'chickenlik', 'white', 'meat', 'fake', 'grill', 'mark', 'tast', 'realli', 'took', 'away', 'overal', 'sandwich', 'soup', 'salad', 'cours', 'hot', 'beverag', 'serv', 'place', 'well', 'im', 'write', 'yet', 'good', 'first', 'impress']

Generous with the veggies, less so with dumplings, but all the soups have great flavour and are decently sized for the price.

I went here for Sunday lunch with a group for Winterlicious. For $15 we got a choice of appetizer, entree and dessert. 

We arrived first and our table was waiting for us. The restaurant was not busy at that point and our waiter was very attentive with water and the wine menu.

Once our party finally arrived we all ordered. I had their Chipotle Sweet Potato & Goat Cheese Dip, which was average. The salads looked much better and got better reviews. Same with the soup. The dip was literally a dollap of dip at the side of the plate with some crostinis on the other end and 1 piece of pickled cauliflower and a few slices of onion in the middle. The dip was good, the pickled cauliflower alright. It was nice when all combined on the crostini (pickled veggies, dip on top of crostini). 

I had originally wanted to order the double pork slider, but I saw it arrive at someone else's table and it was literally just the one, single mini pork sandwich, with a few thinly cut fries at the side. It looked good, but it was appetizer size, IF THAT. The chicken sandwich was more reasonably sized, so I ordered that. It was good. I really liked the bread. The macaroni was also more reasonably sized. I sampled it and it was fine. Didn't blow me away. 

Dessert was the highlight of the meal for everyone I think. Some people ordered the mousse, which I thought was fine, but the people who ordered it loved, so there you have it. My husband loved his apple terrine, which I tried and was good. I liked the flavour of my creme brule very much, but the top was over toasted and had hardened to the consistency of a thin, hard candy. It was hard to break with my spoon and got stuck in my teeth. 

The service was consistently good, so no complaints there. None of us had wine with our lunch (although some had other drinks), so I can't comment there. 

This is a tapas bar, so I expect sizes to be small. BUT when sizes are small I expect them to be priced accordingly and\/or to be in sharable portions. They gave the prices of each dish if you were to purchased them individually. These would all be hard to share and wouldn't really be worth it. They are nice as a Winterlicious meal, but I'm not sure this would be my first choice to go back to."	1	0	0	['would', 'inclin', 'give', 'place', 'star', 'sinc', 'that', 'possibl', 'im', 'round', 'went', 'sunday', 'lunch', 'group', 'winterlici', 'got', 'choic', 'appet', 'entre', 'dessert', 'arriv', 'first', 'tabl', 'wait', 'us', 'restaur', 'busi', 'point', 'waiter', 'attent', 'water', 'wine', 'menuonc', 'parti', 'final', 'arriv', 'order', 'chipotl', 'sweet', 'potato', 'goat', 'chees', 'dip', 'averag', 'salad', 'look', 'much', 'better', 'got', 'better', 'review', 'soup', 'dip', 'liter', 'dollap', 'dip', 'side', 'plate', 'crostini', 'end', 'piec', 'pickl', 'cauliflow', 'slice', 'onion', 'middl', 'dip', 'good', 'pickl', 'cauliflow', 'alright', 'nice', 'combin', 'crostini', 'pickl', 'veggi', 'dip', 'top', 'crostini', 'origin', 'want', 'order', 'doubl', 'pork', 'slider', 'saw', 'arriv', 'someon', 'els', 'tabl', 'liter', 'one', 'singl', 'mini', 'pork', 'sandwich', 'thinli', 'cut', 'fri', 'side', 'look', 'good', 'appet', 'size', 'chicken', 'sandwich', 'reason', 'size', 'order', 'good', 'realli', 'like', 'bread', 'macaroni', 'also', 'reason', 'size', 'sampl', 'fine', 'didnt', 'blow', 'away', 'dessert', 'highlight', 'meal', 'everyon', 'think', 'peopl', 'order', 'mouss', 'thought', 'fine', 'peopl', 'order', 'love', 'husband', 'love', 'appl', 'terrin', 'tri', 'good', 'like', 'flavour', 'creme', 'brule', 'much', 'top', 'toast', 'harden', 'consist', 'thin', 'hard', 'candi', 'hard', 'break', 'spoon', 'got', 'stuck', 'teeth', 'servic', 'consist', 'good', 'complaint', 'none', 'us', 'wine', 'lunch', 'although', 'drink', 'cant', 'comment', 'tapa', 'bar', 'expect', 'size', 'small', 'size', 'small', 'expect', 'price', 'accordingli', 'andor', 'sharabl', 'portion', 'gave', 'price', 'dish', 'purchas', 'individu', 'would', 'hard', 'share', 'wouldnt', 'realli', 'worth', 'nice', 'winterlici', 'meal', 'im', 'sure', 'would', 'first', 'choic', 'go', 'back']

Especially given how busy and cramped it was. There were no tables, but they got us seats at the bar. The music was maybe a little loud, but I enjoyed the 90s throwback that was happening. The place looks like a dive, it's a total hole in the wall, with no signs to speak of, but I liked the weird atmosphere of weird, old ""ghetto blasters"" on the walls and pics of Arnold in Terminator. It's random, just go with it...
But the food....OH the FOOD! We were told that the squash poutine was a must have, so I ordered that and the bulgogi cheese steak, while my friend ordered the poutine and the mackerel. The mackerel was served first. It arrived raw, on a platter and a torch was taken to it to sear the outside and that was it. My friend allowed me a bite and it was so fresh tasting, with a delicious marinade. Next came by bulgogi sandwich. Fresh, delicious bread and amazing bulgogi. Was very pleased. Finally the ""poutines"" arrived. I should say that it was not what we were expecting. I assumed it would be squash on top of fries. But in fact the squash was the fries. THey were lightly fried and covered in a variety of sauce ""gravies"" and scallions and some other stuff that I could neither make out, nor even see clearly (dim lighting). It doesn't matter okay....this stuff was HEAVEN! Both my friend and I took a bite and looked at each other...and proclaimed our new favourite food. 
Other people in our party got the wings, which looked amazing and they said they were and The Loosey, which was also proclaimed as delicious. So basically there were no wrong moves. The drink menu was very adventurous...more so than we were, because we didn't take the plunge, although it was fun sitting at the bar and watching the bartender creating them. And splitting the bill for my friend with two others (her birthday), my two ""tapas"" and a generic alcoholic beverage came to just under $30. The prices are extremely reasonable...and honestly once you try this stuff...I mean, I don't want to give them any ideas, but I would have paid more for that fine, fine food. I will be back. Need me some more of that poutine!"	1	0	1	['surpris', 'peopl', 'complain', 'servic', 'found', 'servic', 'fine', 'especi', 'given', 'busi', 'cramp', 'tabl', 'got', 'us', 'seat', 'bar', 'music', 'mayb', 'littl', 'loud', 'enjoy', 'throwback', 'happen', 'place', 'look', 'like', 'dive', 'total', 'hole', 'wall', 'sign', 'speak', 'like', 'weird', 'atmospher', 'weird', 'old', 'ghetto', 'blaster', 'wall', 'pic', 'arnold', 'termin', 'random', 'go', 'itbut', 'foodoh', 'food', 'told', 'squash', 'poutin', 'must', 'order', 'bulgogi', 'chees', 'steak', 'friend', 'order', 'poutin', 'mackerel', 'mackerel', 'serv', 'first', 'arriv', 'raw', 'platter', 'torch', 'taken', 'sear', 'outsid', 'friend', 'allow', 'bite', 'fresh', 'tast', 'delici', 'marinad', 'next', 'came', 'bulgogi', 'sandwich', 'fresh', 'delici', 'bread', 'amaz', 'bulgogi', 'pleas', 'final', 'poutin', 'arriv', 'say', 'expect', 'assum', 'would', 'squash', 'top', 'fri', 'fact', 'squash', 'fri', 'lightli', 'fri', 'cover', 'varieti', 'sauc', 'gravi', 'scallion', 'stuff', 'could', 'neither', 'make', 'even', 'see', 'clearli', 'dim', 'light', 'doesnt', 'matter', 'okaythi', 'stuff', 'heaven', 'friend', 'took', 'bite', 'look', 'otherand', 'proclaim', 'new', 'favourit', 'food', 'peopl', 'parti', 'got', 'wing', 'look', 'amaz', 'said', 'loosey', 'also', 'proclaim', 'delici', 'basic', 'wrong', 'move', 'drink', 'menu', 'adventurousmor', 'didnt', 'take', 'plung', 'although', 'fun', 'sit', 'bar', 'watch', 'bartend', 'creat', 'split', 'bill', 'friend', 'two', 'other', 'birthday', 'two', 'tapa', 'gener', 'alcohol', 'beverag', 'came', 'price', 'extrem', 'reasonableand', 'honestli', 'tri', 'stuffi', 'mean', 'dont', 'want', 'give', 'idea', 'would', 'paid', 'fine', 'fine', 'food', 'back', 'need', 'poutin']

Having never had Ethiopian food before, we were curious, but wary. The deal really helped us dive in. It included two appetizers, four main courses and two desserts. We started with two appetizers, one I wasn't a huge fan of (a ""salad"" with a strong vinegar taste and jalapenos, which I found too strong, although other people in my group really liked it). The other appetizer was similar to an Indian samosa (similar name too, but I can't remember exactly what it was called). They were stuff with lentils and had a flaky shell. They were DELICIOUS. BUT, their appetizers were only made for three people, so there were only three of them! Seems silly when you offer a four person deal. 
We each ordered a different main course and they brought them on one large platter, so we could all share. We ordered two vegetarian options, one of lentils and one of chickpeas and one of chicken and one of beef. Basically, the meals are more sauces than anything and they are served with injera, which are sort of bland, cold, bread-like stuff, which comes rolled up. They're nothing special, but they're only used as a sort of utensil, because you use it to scoop up the food. The food was delicious! I especially liked the chickpea dish. Every one of us ended up liking a different dish the best! Worked out well. I personally found the beef dish very tough though. 
Once we were stuff with the food, we ordered two desserts. We especially liked the cheesecake (which is obviously not Ethiopian). 
We asked if they had any Ethiopian coffees and they said yes. THey showed us the beans, as they were being roasted. Then they came back out with a sort of stone earthenware kettle and some small cups. The coffee was so rich, it was almost like chocolate. They also served it with a large basket of popcorn, which was just perfectly prepared. It was such a nice after dinner snack! I would totally come here just to order the coffee! 
It would have been a very expensive dinner without the groupon, so I'm not sure I would make this a regularly destination, but as I said, the coffee was fantastic and it's a fun thing to try, especially with friends. Make sure they're good ones, that you don't mind getting messy in front of!"	1	0	0	['friend', 'got', 'groupon', 'four', 'peopl', 'took', 'us', 'along', 'im', 'pleas', 'went', 'never', 'ethiopian', 'food', 'curiou', 'wari', 'deal', 'realli', 'help', 'us', 'dive', 'includ', 'two', 'appet', 'four', 'main', 'cours', 'two', 'dessert', 'start', 'two', 'appet', 'one', 'wasnt', 'huge', 'fan', 'salad', 'strong', 'vinegar', 'tast', 'jalapeno', 'found', 'strong', 'although', 'peopl', 'group', 'realli', 'like', 'appet', 'similar', 'indian', 'samosa', 'similar', 'name', 'cant', 'rememb', 'exactli', 'call', 'stuff', 'lentil', 'flaki', 'shell', 'delici', 'appet', 'made', 'three', 'peopl', 'three', 'seem', 'silli', 'offer', 'four', 'person', 'deal', 'order', 'differ', 'main', 'cours', 'brought', 'one', 'larg', 'platter', 'could', 'share', 'order', 'two', 'vegetarian', 'option', 'one', 'lentil', 'one', 'chickpea', 'one', 'chicken', 'one', 'beef', 'basic', 'meal', 'sauc', 'anyth', 'serv', 'injera', 'sort', 'bland', 'cold', 'breadlik', 'stuff', 'come', 'roll', 'theyr', 'noth', 'special', 'theyr', 'use', 'sort', 'utensil', 'use', 'scoop', 'food', 'food', 'delici', 'especi', 'like', 'chickpea', 'dish', 'everi', 'one', 'us', 'end', 'like', 'differ', 'dish', 'best', 'work', 'well', 'person', 'found', 'beef', 'dish', 'tough', 'though', 'stuff', 'food', 'order', 'two', 'dessert', 'especi', 'like', 'cheesecak', 'obvious', 'ethiopian', 'ask', 'ethiopian', 'coffe', 'said', 'ye', 'show', 'us', 'bean', 'roast', 'came', 'back', 'sort', 'stone', 'earthenwar', 'kettl', 'small', 'cup', 'coffe', 'rich', 'almost', 'like', 'chocol', 'also', 'serv', 'larg', 'basket', 'popcorn', 'perfectli', 'prepar', 'nice', 'dinner', 'snack', 'would', 'total', 'come', 'order', 'coffe', 'would', 'expens', 'dinner', 'without', 'groupon', 'im', 'sure', 'would', 'make', 'regularli', 'destin', 'said', 'coffe', 'fantast', 'fun', 'thing', 'tri', 'especi', 'friend', 'make', 'sure', 'theyr', 'good', 'one', 'dont', 'mind', 'get', 'messi', 'front']

Origin is pretty new in our area and is very large, but nicely decorated. My only comment would be the washrooms, which feature communal sinks, the kind you find in elementary schools, where you step on the thing at the bottom and water comes out all around. Besides not being very effective to quickly wash hands, it's also wasteful if you're the only one there. Strange concept. Throw back, but not necessarily one wants to remember during their brunch.  
Now onto the important part...the food and service.
Service started out alright and then immediately got very slow. It took some time to get our drink orders and then took a LONG time to get our actual orders. 
I ordered their French toast, my sister ordered tostada and my husband skipped brunch and ordered a meal they offered of a burger, fries covered in some chorizo and sauce and a float. I also ordered a side of bacon...and was told that they were out of bacon...which meant any orders that would have come with bacon were out entirely, or would be served without bacon. I'm sorry but a brunch restaurant without bacon? Even the waitress admitted it was ridiculous.
We also shared a plate of buscuits with their preserves. These were delicious.
Apparently my meal was the one that took the longest. The others got their food and we still waited for five minutes before mine came out. Who knew it would take so long to put a couple of pieces of bread on a plate and cover them with blueberry preserves?
My sister said her tostada was quite good. My French toast was nothing special. The toast was ""fancy"", rounded pieces, on top of each other with whipped cream and blueberries in between. The ""maple"" which was supposed to be on the plate (maple syrup I'm guessing) was barely present. Tasted like something I could have created with some ease.
My husband's dish was the best by far. His burger was juicy and this fries were great. The float was a little silly...this big, meaty burger and fries covered in more meat...paired with a cream soda float in pink and white layers. (Not insulting, we just got a laugh). 
Nothing was cheap and then we had to wait a long time again to get our bill and pay. This was all strange because the restaurant was not particularly busy.
Because the brunch itself didn't blow me away, food shortages and service, I'm not sure if I would bother with brunch again. Oliver and Bonicini in the actual mall has a much better brunch. I might try this again for lunch or dinner though."	0	0	0	['sister', 'told', 'origin', 'well', 'known', 'delici', 'brunch', 'made', 'trip', 'see', 'case', 'origin', 'pretti', 'new', 'area', 'larg', 'nice', 'decor', 'comment', 'would', 'washroom', 'featur', 'commun', 'sink', 'kind', 'find', 'elementari', 'school', 'step', 'thing', 'bottom', 'water', 'come', 'around', 'besid', 'effect', 'quickli', 'wash', 'hand', 'also', 'wast', 'your', 'one', 'strang', 'concept', 'throw', 'back', 'necessarili', 'one', 'want', 'rememb', 'brunch', 'onto', 'import', 'partth', 'food', 'serviceservic', 'start', 'alright', 'immedi', 'got', 'slow', 'took', 'time', 'get', 'drink', 'order', 'took', 'long', 'time', 'get', 'actual', 'order', 'order', 'french', 'toast', 'sister', 'order', 'tostada', 'husband', 'skip', 'brunch', 'order', 'meal', 'offer', 'burger', 'fri', 'cover', 'chorizo', 'sauc', 'float', 'also', 'order', 'side', 'baconand', 'told', 'baconwhich', 'meant', 'order', 'would', 'come', 'bacon', 'entir', 'would', 'serv', 'without', 'bacon', 'im', 'sorri', 'brunch', 'restaur', 'without', 'bacon', 'even', 'waitress', 'admit', 'ridiculousw', 'also', 'share', 'plate', 'buscuit', 'preserv', 'deliciousappar', 'meal', 'one', 'took', 'longest', 'other', 'got', 'food', 'still', 'wait', 'five', 'minut', 'mine', 'came', 'knew', 'would', 'take', 'long', 'put', 'coupl', 'piec', 'bread', 'plate', 'cover', 'blueberri', 'preservesmi', 'sister', 'said', 'tostada', 'quit', 'good', 'french', 'toast', 'noth', 'special', 'toast', 'fanci', 'round', 'piec', 'top', 'whip', 'cream', 'blueberri', 'mapl', 'suppos', 'plate', 'mapl', 'syrup', 'im', 'guess', 'bare', 'present', 'tast', 'like', 'someth', 'could', 'creat', 'easemi', 'husband', 'dish', 'best', 'far', 'burger', 'juici', 'fri', 'great', 'float', 'littl', 'sillythi', 'big', 'meati', 'burger', 'fri', 'cover', 'meatpair', 'cream', 'soda', 'float', 'pink', 'white', 'layer', 'insult', 'got', 'laugh', 'noth', 'cheap', 'wait', 'long', 'time', 'get', 'bill', 'pay', 'strang', 'restaur', 'particularli', 'busybecaus', 'brunch', 'didnt', 'blow', 'away', 'food', 'shortag', 'servic', 'im', 'sure', 'would', 'bother', 'brunch', 'oliv', 'bonicini', 'actual', 'mall', 'much', 'better', 'brunch', 'might', 'tri', 'lunch', 'dinner', 'though']

So first off, the store owner responded to my complaints...by blaming me. Apparently it is MY fault they sent the wrong thing, because I sent an email and then followed it up with a phone call...which confused them and made them think there were two orders or something. Which makes zero sense, because two orders were not sent. And the person I was speaking with on the phone responded to the emails I sent with codes to try out....so I have a hard time believing that they were confused by what was going on and thought that the phone order and email order were different. 

They also told me they blocked me on instagram because I was body shaming their models. I want to be VERY clear on this. I never once body shamed, or made any comments on instagram about their models. I asked why they were promoting clothing they don't even have in stock on instagram...apparently that equates to body shaming to them. 

They also informed me that because they had to mail so many orders to me (3), they were going to start to charge me for shipping. They seemed to forget that I had also been paying to ship items back to them and that I had specifically chosen times when they had free shipping promos taking place to place orders. It's not that they weren't charging me for shipping...it was that I was taking advantage of their own promos. Apparently I can't use their promos anymore, because they have placed an arbitrary rules on how many times you can make a return now. At least for me. 

They did not address the code not working. 

I responded and expressed continued frustration at their lack of ownership over their mistakes and how poor their customer service continued to be. 

Then I did some research and sent another email. Instead of returning the dress I would donate it to Dress for Success. I said this seemed like a better choice than continuing to mail clothing back and forth. My request to them was that they take the would be money they would spend on continuing to mail me clothing and take some ownership for their mistakes and channel it into something good. I asked that they take the remaining $9.98 credit I had and put it towards them making a small donation, either monetarily or a piece of clothing, also to the charity. I stated that their continued neglect for customer service and lack of ownership over repeated problems should be owned up to, but if they wouldn't do it for me, perhaps they would be willing to do so for someone in need. I said that would conclude our business and bring something good out of this ridiculousness. 

A few hours later I received an email with a letter of thanks for a donation made to Dress for Success...for the amount of $10 via the store....so my remainder amount I had paid for and Big Sis Closet's contribution of....two cents. Their generosity is astounding. NOW, I don't know that they haven't made their own donation and just not told me of course...I'll let you guys decide whether you want to give them the benefit of the doubt in that regard. But given that they have taken zero responsibility for the continued poor management and customer service, well...I think you can guess what my thoughts are on the subject. No further correspondence was sent from the actual store. 

But at any rate, I am donating the new dress to Dress for Success (along with my $9.98) and I am officially done with this store for good. And I sincerely hope that people read this review and think twice about shopping here. The clothes are not good quality, but more than that...I have NEVER experienced such insanely bad management and customer service in my life.

The service was good and the atmosphere was nice, for such a small place. Bathrooms were also nice, clean, etc. Only problem is that some of the tables are SO small, it's really hard to use them. We were at a very small one and even though we fit around it alright, a guy walking by knocked a beer over with his coat and it dumped all down me. I mean ALL over me. It's not the bar's fault the guy knocked the glass, but if the table was a bit bigger we would have had more room to put the glass further in, so it wouldn't have gotten knocked in the first place. The fact is, if you're going to serve food people need a place to put it.

Was excited to see a Nutella Latte on the menu, which I ordered and which was good, but lacking much in the way of being really ""nutella-ish"", other than a slight hazelnut flavour. 

Ordered pistachio and .....some hazelnut\/chocolate gelato (can't remember the specific name) and both were great. Service was lovely. Nice, cozy little place. 

I wish there were a bit more in terms of other desserts besides gelato. There were a large selection of macaroons, but some biscotti, or little mini cupcakes or something, would be great with the latte. I know, I know, it's a gelato place.

One of my favs, Chimichanga's, has disappeared, so we got to a point where we were just calling around to see WHO could take us. Finally...La Revolucion answered!

We walked in and were greeted with....a dishwasher, sitting in the middle of the floor. Sort of strange...maybe some kitchen renos? We walked to meet our friends and their table and were informed that the reservations were not made, or were forgotten and the waitress had had to kick out a single guy from the table and he was eating at the bar. Maybe he was lucky, because the table was SO sticky underneath that my shoes were sticking to the ground. I mean STICKING!

She took our drink orders and then gave us our drinks and walked away. It took us another 15 minutes before we could place our order. Around the table we ordered two burritos, one plate of tacos and one quesadilla and guacamole bites (which is basically nachos and guac). 

The guac came out fast, and was quite good, but we then waited for almost forty minutes for our food!

Burritos were a bit bland. Needs some sauce in, or on top. Quesadillas were the same...nothing special. The tacos got favorable reviews, but again, nothing to write home about. 

The back area houses a sort of club-like atmosphere, which is described in blogto as: ""...dark textured walls and ambient lighting, it is the opposite of its cocina counterpart. Records adorn the walls and instruments lay strewn about, giving it a relaxed basement rec-room vibe...July will see live music on Thursdays and Fridays with open jam Tuesdays. Flamenco Saturdays are in the works...""

When we were there (on a Saturday) there was a sign out front for a ""dance party"". The lights were down in the back, with a sort of laser light show and early 90s hip hop music was playing. There were about three, older guys there, just hanging out, drinking. It seemed totally out of place. The music didn't match, certainly wasn't flamenco and that's a weird rec room vibe...if that's even something you would want in a restaurant.

I think this place has potential. People in the area like it and it has a nice vibe to it...or would, had we had better service and less stickiness and washers sitting around. I feel like the space is just not being utilized and that's a shame. 

I WOULD have giving this place two stars, but the extra star was a result of the sangria, which is their ""secret recipe"" and were amazing. I had two actually.

Anyway, if I was in the area, I might stop in again, as everything was fine, but I don't think I'll be making any special trips to go there in the future. Don't think I'll be going for any dance parties!"	4	0	0	['well', 'decid', 'whim', 'want', 'mexican', 'food', 'call', 'around', 'place', 'highli', 'rate', 'seat', 'avail', 'one', 'fav', 'chimichanga', 'disappear', 'got', 'point', 'call', 'around', 'see', 'could', 'take', 'us', 'finallyla', 'revolucion', 'answeredw', 'walk', 'greet', 'witha', 'dishwash', 'sit', 'middl', 'floor', 'sort', 'strangemayb', 'kitchen', 'reno', 'walk', 'meet', 'friend', 'tabl', 'inform', 'reserv', 'made', 'forgotten', 'waitress', 'kick', 'singl', 'guy', 'tabl', 'eat', 'bar', 'mayb', 'lucki', 'tabl', 'sticki', 'underneath', 'shoe', 'stick', 'ground', 'mean', 'stickingsh', 'took', 'drink', 'order', 'gave', 'us', 'drink', 'walk', 'away', 'took', 'us', 'anoth', 'minut', 'could', 'place', 'order', 'around', 'tabl', 'order', 'two', 'burrito', 'one', 'plate', 'taco', 'one', 'quesadilla', 'guacamol', 'bite', 'basic', 'nacho', 'guac', 'guac', 'came', 'fast', 'quit', 'good', 'wait', 'almost', 'forti', 'minut', 'foodburrito', 'bit', 'bland', 'need', 'sauc', 'top', 'quesadilla', 'samenoth', 'special', 'taco', 'got', 'favor', 'review', 'noth', 'write', 'home', 'back', 'area', 'hous', 'sort', 'clublik', 'atmospher', 'describ', 'blogto', 'dark', 'textur', 'wall', 'ambient', 'light', 'opposit', 'cocina', 'counterpart', 'record', 'adorn', 'wall', 'instrument', 'lay', 'strewn', 'give', 'relax', 'basement', 'recroom', 'vibejuli', 'see', 'live', 'music', 'thursday', 'friday', 'open', 'jam', 'tuesday', 'flamenco', 'saturday', 'workswhen', 'saturday', 'sign', 'front', 'danc', 'parti', 'light', 'back', 'sort', 'laser', 'light', 'show', 'earli', 'hip', 'hop', 'music', 'play', 'three', 'older', 'guy', 'hang', 'drink', 'seem', 'total', 'place', 'music', 'didnt', 'match', 'certainli', 'wasnt', 'flamenco', 'that', 'weird', 'rec', 'room', 'vibeif', 'that', 'even', 'someth', 'would', 'want', 'restauranti', 'think', 'place', 'potenti', 'peopl', 'area', 'like', 'nice', 'vibe', 'itor', 'would', 'better', 'servic', 'less', 'sticki', 'washer', 'sit', 'around', 'feel', 'like', 'space', 'util', 'that', 'shame', 'would', 'give', 'place', 'two', 'star', 'extra', 'star', 'result', 'sangria', 'secret', 'recip', 'amaz', 'two', 'actuallyanyway', 'area', 'might', 'stop', 'everyth', 'fine', 'dont', 'think', 'ill', 'make', 'special', 'trip', 'go', 'futur', 'dont', 'think', 'ill', 'go', 'danc', 'parti']

My first thought though was that the restaurant was freezing cold inside, but the atmosphere was nice and the waitress was lovely.

She told us the soup of the day, which was potato garlic and said it could be ordered as a side dish. My friend ordered the salad and the soup and I ordered the calamari sandwich and soup as the side. The sandwich had some great aioli on it and the calamari was nicely done, however I wasn't a huge fan of the bun it was in. It had a sort of sweet taste you might enjoy as a french toast, but not with something savoury and some of the calamari was a little tough. THat said, the sauces covered the taste from the bread and the texture was good and overall it was tasty.

The soup I found to have too much black pepper mixed in. The waitress asked and I mentioned and she brought back a small container with grated parmesan cheese and suggested I mix some in, because it cuts the pepper taste. 

She was right! It really helped the soup. She said she does this with soups here all the time...which I'm not sure if a very complimentary review of the soups.

My friend said her salad was great and she liked the pepper, but agreed the cheese in the soup made it better. 

So while everything was overall A-Okay, it wasn't fantastic. It's solid though and I would go back and try something else another time."	1	0	0	['went', 'lunch', 'friend', 'told', 'consist', 'good', 'food', 'prior', 'occas', 'first', 'thought', 'though', 'restaur', 'freez', 'cold', 'insid', 'atmospher', 'nice', 'waitress', 'lovelysh', 'told', 'us', 'soup', 'day', 'potato', 'garlic', 'said', 'could', 'order', 'side', 'dish', 'friend', 'order', 'salad', 'soup', 'order', 'calamari', 'sandwich', 'soup', 'side', 'sandwich', 'great', 'aioli', 'calamari', 'nice', 'done', 'howev', 'wasnt', 'huge', 'fan', 'bun', 'sort', 'sweet', 'tast', 'might', 'enjoy', 'french', 'toast', 'someth', 'savouri', 'calamari', 'littl', 'tough', 'said', 'sauc', 'cover', 'tast', 'bread', 'textur', 'good', 'overal', 'tastyth', 'soup', 'found', 'much', 'black', 'pepper', 'mix', 'waitress', 'ask', 'mention', 'brought', 'back', 'small', 'contain', 'grate', 'parmesan', 'chees', 'suggest', 'mix', 'cut', 'pepper', 'tast', 'right', 'realli', 'help', 'soup', 'said', 'soup', 'timewhich', 'im', 'sure', 'complimentari', 'review', 'soupsmi', 'friend', 'said', 'salad', 'great', 'like', 'pepper', 'agre', 'chees', 'soup', 'made', 'better', 'everyth', 'overal', 'aokay', 'wasnt', 'fantast', 'solid', 'though', 'would', 'go', 'back', 'tri', 'someth', 'els', 'anoth', 'time']

Okay, well maybe not, but this place was still great!

It was a complete fluke...some may venture so far as to call it fate...we walked in here off the street, looking for some dinner and decided to give it a go. Perhaps it was angels??

We ordered two pizzas and split them. One pizza = a good size meal for a person, so we were stuffed and happy at the end.

Service was good and pizzas came out fast and fresh from the oven. Nice, crispy crusts and gooey centres. Yummy!

The waiter accidentally dropped a fork on me when he was taking away our plates and apologized profusely. No biggie....particularly because he was so apologetic. (Let's face it, if someone makes a small mistake, but acts like ""it ain't no thang"" we get a little turned off). 

Problems: Well, it's a bit pricey and the tables were set really closely together. It did feel like we were eating dinner with some strangers a bit.

Firstly, I should mention that the menu is very small. Most of the food has an Italian feel to it (it IS in Little Italy), but that feels a bit strange given the huge martini list. 

We were hungry though, so we ordered dinner and it was honestly pretty good! I'm not sure if this would be my choice if I was JUST looking for dinner out, but not bad if you're feeling lazy, and not wanting to bother going somewhere different for your alcohol and food, like what we were feeling. 

This is a martini bar and so no big surprise, it has a lot of martinis. That said, I shall repeat it...it has a LOT of martinis!! Over 100 different martinis and every one of the ones I tried, I enjoyed. And I tried a good five or something. This may ALSO account for my remembering a good time.

The service was good too. When I mentioned that I really liked the sauce my pasta came in, the waiter brought me extra sauce in a dish, with bread to dip it in. Weird, but I really enjoyed this...what can I say? I had had like 5-6 martinis!

That was why we chose to order from this place and it was a BIG mistake. My husband called and placed the order and we got a call back saying they had taken down his credit card number incorrectly. Then they called back a few minutes later because they needed directions to our place. 
We proceeded to get three more calls from a driver asking us where to go. The confusing thing was that he would ask, but then either carry on a conversation on another phone, or with someone who was with him, instead of listening. Then he would ask for my husband to repeat himself. This happened at least twice every call, for three calls. 

Turns out they took the address down completely wrong. Big surprise, considering their listening skills. 

We finally got our food and they had screwed up the order and given us a wrong sushi roll. Either way the sushi was among the worst we have tasted. It was a mixture of bland and salty! Basically it was terrible. 

On a side note, their dragon rolls are actually unagi rolls. Dragon rolls are called dragon rolls (at EVERY other sushi place) because they have avocado on top, making them green. It is very strange that these guys have decided that that's not the way they want to go.

I've never had charcuterie before and I'm not generally a big meat eater, so this was a little out of the box. That said, I like trying to be adventurous and trying new things, so when are visiting friends suggested we give it a go, we went for it. Dinner service is open at 6pm, so we agreed we'd arrive at 6pm. We got there at about 6:15....there was already a HUGE wait for a table, but we managed to wrangle seats at the bar. 

The four of us ordered a bunch of dishes to split between ourselves. We tried the charcuterie (sort of a platter of assorted sliced meats and p√¢t√©), horse tar tar, roasted bone marrow, pork carnitas tacos, tongue on brioche and the foie gras and nutella for dessert. 

The dishes came out staggered, so we got to sit around chatting and enjoying ourselves and our cocktails. The charcuterie came out first. It was assorted sliced meats arranged on a wood plank and served with bread. It was actually really nice. Next was the horse tar tar. This was a stretch for me. I don't generally like to eat animals that I LIKE. The people I was with convinced me to try a small bit and I must say, it tasted pretty good, but on principle, I just have trouble with it. Sorry! I hate being one of those people who doesn't have a problem killing the ""ugly"" animals, but doesn't want the cute ones to die...but I am. 

Next was the bone marrow, which was....well let's just say I had to keep telling myself not to think about what I was eating. Basically, it's a big bone and the marrow is of course in the middle and has been cooked so that it's almost the consistency of warm butter...pretty fatty and oily looking. You scoop it out with a spoon and put it on bread. It's actually delicious, but feels like you're eating something you shouldn't, purely for health reasons if nothing else! It feels like eating pure fat....tastes as good I suppose. 

We had the tongue on brioche, which I was only okay with. The tongue was sliced and presented as a sort of Montreal smoked meat. We were told to open it up and eat it like an open faced sandwich. This made it easier to split certainly. The meat itself was very tender and the brioche was great, but the meat had a horseradish (I think) sauce, which was a bit overpowering. 

Finally we had the tacos, which was probably the more ""normal"" thing we had. I actually thought those were my favorite. Wish it was one of the more exciting things, but nope. Those tacos were excellent. 

The foie gras with nutella was also delicious. It was served on a banana bread, over a nutella spread...but the fois gras was superflous. It didn't add any taste and was overpowered but the nutella and basically didn't add anything to the dish. Could have been served without. Clearly just added to SAY it was there. 

So what's the overall opinion? Well, the restaurant is too small. It's REALLY small, but popular. Wish it was in a bigger location. Sitting at the bar was kind of interesting, because all the cooking was done behind the bar, but that was a small workspace and it got hot, because the oven, dishwasher, stove top and so forth were always turned up very hight. Impressive how they work in such a space though.

Overall the food was very good. SOMEONE knows what they are doing. However, it is quite a pricey place and as I said, sometimes the flavours overpower the meat, or the meat just isn't even necessary. Sometimes you're paying extra for fancy meat dishes that don't even need the meat, or where you can't TASTE the meat. 

Those are the only criticisms, but I wouldn't let that keep you from trying this place...but only if you're willing to go out on a limb a bit and as something different. This isn't a go-to place, but it's a fun place to have gone to!

Cafe Polonez was in a great little area, with lots of nice, little shops surrounding it and High Park, of course. 

The restaurant is clean and trendy looking and we took a seat, against the wall, in the back. We ordered the platter for two. Since we had never been, it felt like a good idea to try it ALL out. GREAT idea! We were delivered a platter of food that included two schnitzels, two cabbage rolls, 6 perogies and some other sides. Everything was great, but the schnitzel and cabbage rolls in particular were excellent! I ordered two gravies to go with the schnitzel, expecting two, little Swiss Chalet-sized gravies, but instead we got two, huge bowls of gravy. Needless to say, one bowl would have been more than enough for 2 people. They were only $1 apiece, so not the end of the world. 

Plenty of food for two people and a great sampler platter to see what they have and what you like.

Service was fast and good and everything was excellent. Totally recommend it and I'll be back.

I should mention that it was a lot less improv than I expected. I wasn't entirely sure what to expect, but it was basically, short, individual skits, creating a sort of sketch comedy act, as opposed to improv. This isn't a bad thing. I'm a HUGE fan of SNL, but I was say that I probably laughed more consistently during this performance, than your average episode of SNL. This is because of a combination of personal ""current Toronto"" jokes and because that's the way it should be when you have a couple of months to be putting together your next show, as opposed to one week (as with SNL). I would only expect a more refined show. In addition, we came close to the end of this show's run, so the kinks would presumably be figured out and they told us they were testing some of the new material on us, so that was kind of cool! 

The skits were mostly successful, none failed to make us laugh out loud at least once. There were no weak links in terms of the actors, but the stand outs (for me) were a red headed girl and the black guy....sorry I have no names! I can only go by really obvious characteristics. 

We stuck around after, as they did a little bit of actual improv and another skit, which seemed like an idea they were trying to hash out a little more. Well worth the sticking around even later for!

Why the lack of one star? Well those pictures down below don't really accurately describe what this place looks like when it's full of people. The chairs are small, there is no coat check and you're all crammed around a very small table. Your coats end up...wherever basically. 

Probably because I booked the tickets on the Wednesday before (I'm not sure how they determine seats...it's not first come, first served and it's not on your ticket...that I could see), we originally ended up in a back corner, on high bar stools. My skirt made it so that I kept sliding off the seat! I asked if there was any way we could be moved into regular seats, but the only thing left (and this is how I know seats are prearranged, because there were tonnes of empty seats all around at that time), were right in the front, next to the stage, but to the far side. From this angle, you can't see everything, but we enjoyed it more being right up, near the action. 

That said, it was still VERY crowded and uncomfortable. Tickets are $30 each (here is a tip...it's a little less if you have a CAA membership and order through them), so that's pretty pricey. The show makes it worth it, it truly does. The seating takes away from it. 

BUT you can order drinks, which we did and that make just about anything better, so hey! 

At the end of the day, I'll just make sure I wear pants next time and order tickets further in advance and either way it won't stop me from checking out another performance. It's worth a night of non-stop laughter."	0	0	0	['never', 'improv', 'perform', 'excit', 'check', 'heard', 'good', 'thing', 'chose', 'second', 'citi', 'oppos', 'cheaper', 'bad', 'dog', 'theatr', 'mention', 'lot', 'less', 'improv', 'expect', 'wasnt', 'entir', 'sure', 'expect', 'basic', 'short', 'individu', 'skit', 'creat', 'sort', 'sketch', 'comedi', 'act', 'oppos', 'improv', 'isnt', 'bad', 'thing', 'im', 'huge', 'fan', 'snl', 'say', 'probabl', 'laugh', 'consist', 'perform', 'averag', 'episod', 'snl', 'combin', 'person', 'current', 'toronto', 'joke', 'that', 'way', 'coupl', 'month', 'put', 'togeth', 'next', 'show', 'oppos', 'one', 'week', 'snl', 'would', 'expect', 'refin', 'show', 'addit', 'came', 'close', 'end', 'show', 'run', 'kink', 'would', 'presum', 'figur', 'told', 'us', 'test', 'new', 'materi', 'us', 'kind', 'cool', 'skit', 'mostli', 'success', 'none', 'fail', 'make', 'us', 'laugh', 'loud', 'least', 'weak', 'link', 'term', 'actor', 'stand', 'out', 'red', 'head', 'girl', 'black', 'guysorri', 'name', 'go', 'realli', 'obviou', 'characterist', 'stuck', 'around', 'littl', 'bit', 'actual', 'improv', 'anoth', 'skit', 'seem', 'like', 'idea', 'tri', 'hash', 'littl', 'well', 'worth', 'stick', 'around', 'even', 'later', 'forwhi', 'lack', 'one', 'star', 'well', 'pictur', 'dont', 'realli', 'accur', 'describ', 'place', 'look', 'like', 'full', 'peopl', 'chair', 'small', 'coat', 'check', 'your', 'cram', 'around', 'small', 'tabl', 'coat', 'end', 'upwherev', 'basic', 'probabl', 'book', 'ticket', 'wednesday', 'im', 'sure', 'determin', 'seatsit', 'first', 'come', 'first', 'serv', 'ticketthat', 'could', 'see', 'origin', 'end', 'back', 'corner', 'high', 'bar', 'stool', 'skirt', 'made', 'kept', 'slide', 'seat', 'ask', 'way', 'could', 'move', 'regular', 'seat', 'thing', 'left', 'know', 'seat', 'prearrang', 'tonn', 'empti', 'seat', 'around', 'time', 'right', 'front', 'next', 'stage', 'far', 'side', 'angl', 'cant', 'see', 'everyth', 'enjoy', 'right', 'near', 'action', 'said', 'still', 'crowd', 'uncomfort', 'ticket', 'tipit', 'littl', 'less', 'caa', 'membership', 'order', 'that', 'pretti', 'pricey', 'show', 'make', 'worth', 'truli', 'seat', 'take', 'away', 'order', 'drink', 'make', 'anyth', 'better', 'hey', 'end', 'day', 'ill', 'make', 'sure', 'wear', 'pant', 'next', 'time', 'order', 'ticket', 'advanc', 'either', 'way', 'wont', 'stop', 'check', 'anoth', 'perform', 'worth', 'night', 'nonstop', 'laughter']

We went and had our breakfasts, which was served by a rather surely waitress and was average. If this had been our only experience, I would have given three stars, but another night we got in very late and were just looking for a late dinner and found ourselves at this place.
It was not very crowded, but was as loud as if three times as many people were there. There was a small group of trashy (very obese people), scream\/singing karaoke on a stage in the front of the restaurant. One of them was singing Eminem and the others were screaming and cheering. We sat down in the back, to try and avoid the chaos, but it was way too disruptive. Other people sitting there, who were in the middle of their dinners and therefore stuck there, were looking pained. We didn't bother putting ourselves through this and left. It's a crappy menu, that's overpriced anyway.

Why? Well for starters, the gentleman who owns the establishment is lovely and personable. I think their portions are large and the fish to be yummy and not too bland, or overly breaded. I also really like that they make their OWN tartar sauce. So few places seem to do this. You get like 1-2 of those little packets. 
One star off for having to buy the tartar sauce separately, and for it being rather small portions. I KNOW tartar sauce is not that premium of an item...why does no one include it in the price, or at least give a nice, proper portion? Such a small thing to make a big difference.
That said, this is my first choice in the area. Would be interested in trying their pork souvlaki, but when you're going to the fish and chips place...it's sort of a given to get the fish and chips."	0	0	0	['great', 'littl', 'place', 'one', 'fav', 'area', 'happen', 'number', 'fish', 'chip', 'place', 'actual', 'well', 'starter', 'gentleman', 'own', 'establish', 'love', 'person', 'think', 'portion', 'larg', 'fish', 'yummi', 'bland', 'overli', 'bread', 'also', 'realli', 'like', 'make', 'tartar', 'sauc', 'place', 'seem', 'get', 'like', 'littl', 'packet', 'one', 'star', 'buy', 'tartar', 'sauc', 'separ', 'rather', 'small', 'portion', 'know', 'tartar', 'sauc', 'premium', 'itemwhi', 'one', 'includ', 'price', 'least', 'give', 'nice', 'proper', 'portion', 'small', 'thing', 'make', 'big', 'differencethat', 'said', 'first', 'choic', 'area', 'would', 'interest', 'tri', 'pork', 'souvlaki', 'your', 'go', 'fish', 'chip', 'placeit', 'sort', 'given', 'get', 'fish', 'chip']

I'm a little confused by the earlier reviews...well...I'm confused by ONE earlier review. But then again, not really, because some people are...well...the way they are! Whatcha gonna do??

As with traditional Italian restaurants (both in the city AND in Italy), the waiters do not coddle you. 

Anyway, the service was great. We had a very attentive waiter. He asked us where we would prefer to sit and we chose a seat for two, but the window. 

The menu is extensive, with a lot of choice. I was debating between a couple of dishes, so my friend suggested we order two things and share. She ordered a pasta dish and I ordered a pizza. 

While we waited for the main course, we were given a basket and soft bread and oil and vinegar...mmmmmmmm....

Our food came out and both dishes were DELICIOUS! The pasta was great, the sauce was especially good. The pizza had mozzarella and goat cheese and veggies...goat cheese on pizza = perfecto! 

We had leftovers....and then we decided to hell with self control and ate them. 

Needless to say, we were too stuffed for dessert. Shame, because they looked very good.

Turns out that this is not the first time I have had food from here. The same friend, used these guys to cater a party she had. She had some large trays of pasta and I remember really enjoying them...you know, as far as catered food goes (to please everyone, they had gotten pastas on the plainer side). 

I think this is a good, solid place. Prices are what you would expect for the food and area.

Why missing one star? I've still had better Italian in the city....I'm picky enough that I need to be REALLY blown away to award 5 stars.

We've always had pretty consistent service and the food as been as good as one expects from this type of place. I usually get their two eggs combo with bacon and toast and I like it because it's basic. Prices are pretty good (although your non-chain greasy spoon will likely have comparable for cheaper). Today I had the spinach and feta cheese omelet and wasn't a fan. Too much feta was rolled up in the omelet and it was all your could taste.

One girl did my toenails and did a nice job, although I loved the colour and the sticker at the bottom of it was missing, so I have no idea what colour I am wearing, should I want to use it again.

The woman doing my nails wasn't as good as the woman doing my toes though. First of all she kept making comments about how small my nails are. I'm an art teacher, so having long nails is really not to my benefit, but thanks for bringing this up constantly! She was also a bit rough.

I think that the amount of gel she put on was WAY too much. Some nails you can see the dip made in the gel. Also, I have only had them a week and I feel like they can be easily ripped off. Things keep getting caught in the edges.

The First Nation's art collection was surprisingly small and not much stood out to me as being really breathtaking. But honestly, I feel that way about the AGO and the National Gallery in Ottawa, unless they are having a special exhibit, so you know...hey, that's Canadian galleries I guess...especially after you get spoiled looking in the galleries in London, Paris and Rome!

We have been ordering from them for years and they switched management some time ago (over a year I think at this point). At first we weren't so sure. The food quality sort of lacked, but they've picked it up and I think the food is great again.

You can get pasta, roast beef and other meats, pizzas. The reason I would go would be for the schnitzel, which is quite good. But they ALWAYS run out. And honestly, NOTHING else here is very good. You can make your own pasta, but it's all very generic tasting and uninspired.

I had never been in before, because the price list was pricey, but decided that given my rush, I would bite the bullet and suck it up.

The people were all very pleasant. I said I was wearing a purple dress and asked for feedback on colours and they gave good opinions and were very nice. Then I was led into a back rooms, where I was instructed to sit on a padded bench and put my feet in a large, metal bowl of water. THIS was a new one. I have never had to put my feet in a mixing bowl while getting nails done.

The seat, while padded, was not particularly comfortable and it was awkward getting up on it and off it again. The pedicure was standard with most places I have been.

The nails were more in keeping with what I was used to, sitting at a nail table. I said I was in a bit of a rush, but she still seemed to really take her time. I didn't push it, because I didn't want to be rude. The nails were fine, but not perfect...some have some bubbling in the polish and others are a bit crooked.

Here's the kicker though...the bill came to $60!! That's almost twice as much as other nail places and it's certainly not a better place in terms of the facilities and job they do! That doesn't even include tip.

The people in there were all older and seemed to be regulars, so I guess they have a customer base, but I certainly won't be part of that! Even in a rush, this place was just not worth it. There are a number of nail salons popping up in the area as it continues to get built up.

They informed us this was because it was almost close, although close wasn't till 7pm...so I guess this is more of a lunch place. That said they had one veal left and one penne pasta left. We bought them both. My toddler, who hates pasta usually, loved this pasta! And I agree with him. It was delicious. My husband liked the sandwich and I also took a bite and it was yummy.

We also bought some very expensive gelato, which was good (and apparently no preservatives, all natural, etc) but was very pricey at over $20 for the smallish tub. The sign in front of the gelato said large takeaway tub was $10...my husband paid, or I would have asked for clarification. I didn't know until after we left, so there was some miscommunication somewhere in there.

The couple were really lovely, gave my son a little chocolate thing for free and chatted with us while we waited.

We ordered the Margherita pizza from their ""gourmet"" pizza menu. It describes the pizza as extra virgin olive oil, mozzarella, provolone, tomatoes, basil, parmesan. The pizza was cheesy and delicious...but there was about one tomato per slice of pizza and the basil was the dried, ""spice"" kind that you shake out of a jar, instead of fresh basil. So I mean the ingredients are anything but gourmet. But it was still really yummy, I won't deny. 

The garlic parm bread was like a slightly classier, better crazy bread from Little Caesars. Also good.

I find that sometimes you get great service the first few times and then they bomb completely. This salon was sort of average the first few times and bombed the third. 

I decided to go to this place  back in the fall, as I was looking for a new stylist. A girl from work goes to this place and said it was pretty good, so I figured I've give it a try. I went in with some different pictures and asked if I should go lighter with some highlights, or darker. The girl said darker, for no real apparent reason and dyed my hair dark brown. Not a hard job and it was fine. 

Second time I went back I wanted some highlights. A had a different girl this time and she gave me partial highlights and then a wash, which made the highlights barely noticeable. Then, because of the wash, it cost around $150! I thought again, it was fine. 

Third time, I wanted something a little more noticeable. I said I specifically wanted my highlights to stand out more this time. I wanted to avoid paying extra, for hardly any change. I brought in pictures and the same girl as last time got to work. 

When she was finshed I was not impressed with the results. There were very noticeable roots all around my head. Especially if you pulled my hair back from my ears, there were dark strips where the roots were and the highlights began. It was not natural. I complained about the roots, so she proceeded to take big sections of hair and bleach them completely, then rubbed the bleach off with a damp towel. It barely looked different when she had finished, but the store was basically past closed and it was clear she had no idea how to fix this mess anyway. 

I had to go and purchase one of those root touch-ups from Shoppers Drug Mart and fix my roots myself. After that, they were alright. Once again it was very expensive.

My friend has been going with me the last few times and I think she has liked her hair, but I won't be going back. I would have to ask specifically for a new stylist and I just don't want the awkwardness and frankly, I just don't trust anyone there anymore anyway.

Overall, our experience was fine and I would probably try it again, but I won't be rushing back. We called to make reservations. I asked for 7 or 7:30 and was told that 7:30 ""would be better"". Assuming that meant 7 was a busy time, we went to the area and were prepared to wander around for a bit...but the restaurant was almost empty, so we went in and were seated promptly. 

Our waitress was very friendly and took our orders. I had the mussels and my husband had the salad. Both were good, although the mussels were quite spicy, something I wish was specified before ordering. 

My husband ordered the pork hock and I had the pasta. His dish was prepared very well and the meat very tender and nice. My pasta however was very bland. the pasta noodles were overcooked and fell apart easily, making it hard to twist in my fork. The limited sauce had little flavour. The chicken and mushrooms in the pasta were the best part, but it wasn't enough to make me consider this a ""good"" dish. More like something I would make for myself at home and be only mildly satisfied. 

When the server gave us our bill, she took away my husband's beer that he was not finished with. We didn't notice until it was too late. 

All this said, I saw other dishes that looked pretty amazing, my husband's food was much better than mine, and despite the beer stealing, the waitress was very nice. The atmosphere made for a nice date spot.

As I said below, when I went to Moroco, it was expensive, but very delicious for a treat. So I decided that I wanted to have my birthday dessert there. I called up to make a reservation for about 10 people. I was informed that for groups of over ten, there is a requirement that every person spends $48! 

I kept the reservation for a day to see how many people were actually going to confirm coming out, but since everyone confirmed, I had to call back and cancel my reservation, because I do not want my guests to be obliged to spend $50 on dessert, after we have already had dinner! The girl on the phone said that it usually worked out, because once people had dessert and a drink, it worked out to be enough. As I said below, let's round up and say dessert is $20...so she's saying their drinks are $28!??! 

I have wanted to go to Moroco for my birthday since the summer, but that was before I realized how pretentious they are! No thanks! Chocolate is great there, but only go with a couple of people, otherwise you'll have to pay the price!

* * * * *

(Original reviews: Oh my gosh, this place is to DIE for. It's also crazy expensive! This isn't a ""daily treat during the work day"" place, it's a ""I'm celebrating something and want a very special treat"" place. Deserts are around the $18\/person range.

That said, the atmosphere was amazing. The place is all in black and white and looks\/feels very trendy. The desserts though....WOW. Amazing! Chocolate fondue that is heavenly! 

Anyway, I've decided that this is where I want to go for my birthday dinner. Forget conventional dinner.

The food is good and the atmosphere is good, but it's quite expensive for what you get (especially for drinks) and I found that the service was mediocre. 

We had quite a large group, so we got a variety of pizzas and split them. This was tricky because the pizzas were all divided into four pieces each. Even though we said we were splitting them all, no one seemed to think to split them up a bit more. 

They were also quite slow with the service, especially taking our order initially. 

But, as I said, the pizzas we ordered were very good. Some stranger combinations were a big hit, like the pear pizza, which worked a bit like a dessert.

All of the employees know me and are always so pleasant. Shuku has styled my hair on several occassions (once for a wedding, once for my bridal shower and once for a birthday party). They were all completely different looks and they were all amazing! She has also done my makeup for me and I've never looked better in photos.

Mainly I got there for the waxing services and Irene always does a great job and is so friendly.

NOW, I just want to state that I cannot CONFIRM that it was this place that gave it to me, but let's just say that I had only eaten finger foods at a bridal shower prior to coming here and shortly after dinner I got sick in the middle of a concert. Super fun AND convenient!

The service was good and this is why this place got the extra star. The guy was truly nice and the service quite fast. 

You wouldn't think the food would make you sick, because it was very bland.  Tasted like something I could have made myself very easily. I ordered the chicken burrito and I found it was quite dry. THey didn't include any sour cream or guacamole, even on the side, so it was just rice and beans and chicken.

Poutine was good...had pulled chicken on it and was tasty, although not entirely unique tasting, but that's fine for this type of place. I had the ODB and it was AMAZE-BALLS! The chicken was a huge portion, on a full waffle. The waffle was the perfect blend of sweetness, with just a bit of syrup and the chicken was crispy and great and so tender it just flaked apart. It had a great sauce on top and the slight kick, blended with the sweetness of the waffle, was a great mix. Portion size was good, food was delicious. Came with a little cup of potato salad...liked the peas, nice touch and the potato salad was a refreshing touch for the whole dish.

So we made reservations at O. Noir. Overall, it was a good time and a good laugh. 

One recommendation: Maybe don't wear your BEST clothes to this place, as there is a very really possibility that you will drop food on yourself. 

THE WAY IT WORKS: For those of you who don't know - You enter into a lounge with brick walls and dim lights. You pre-order your meal and can order drinks from the bar there. THen you are introduced to your waiter(ess), who is visually impaired, and are led into a pitch black room and seated at your table. 

And it IS pitch black. You can't see your hand in front of your face. Your eyes never adjust and there is a sort of entrance way into the room, so you never even get light from the door when someone enters the room. 

You are then served your food and have to go about the task of trying to eat it, while blind. This is a challenge, because you can't see the food and because even when you THINK you've finally speared a veggie, for example, when you bring the fork to your mouth, you realized you've lost it somewhere along the way. Usually into your lap. 

This is DEFINITELY an experience, does an interesting job at raising awareness, but here are my issues with this place: The food was good, but not great. This becomes more apparent when you can't even see the presentation of the food and are reliant entirely on taste. It needs to taste GREAT. This was distinctly forgettable food. 

I would have liked to see the room we were in at the end of the meal. YES, I know this would require everyone eating at the same time, no new people entering, but I was a little sketched out about never seeing where I was. Basically, you could be in dirty, dank basement storage room and you'd never know! 

Finally, it's very expensive! 

I found that I liked it to try once and say I've done it, but it's gimmicky and that doesn't translate well into a place that will become a go-to favorite.

Several months ago I had a hankering for bagels. I decided to give What a Bagel a try and was pleased with their prices (exactly $6 for a dozen bagels) and the taste. They were really, very good! Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, with a variety of flavours to choose from. 

But I had this nagging feeling, because it wasn't a ""traditional Jewish bagel shop"". I swore I wouldn't give a full judgement until I had sampled bagels from Bagel World. Bagel World, which has a few locations in the city, boosts the best bagels IN the city. They also have weird hours though, making it hard to get to on a weeknight.

I finally made it there and grabbed four bagels. My husband and I eagerly sampled the first two...and were VERY disappointed. (See full review under Bagel World).

Decor: Another reviewer mentions that the decor seems to be missing something and I agree. It's boring. The booths had gaps where the seat meets with the wooden bench part that holds the seat part up. Hard to describe, but looks cheap and crappy, like they're broken. Our table was very unbalanced and the waitress came and stuck a coaster under it so it would stop rocking. It's small and very cramped. 

Food: Selection was pretty standard pub fare, but a bit on the expensive side. I ordered a chicken curry dish and when they asked if I wanted it to be spicy or mild I asked for it to be mild. Either their mild is just VERY spicy and I would hate to try their actual spicy, or they made a mistake. The curry comes with the chicken in sauce, rice and a sort of fried crisp, which was nice. The rice was bland however...or the spice from the curry killed my tastebuds. 
My husband chose a burger, which was overall very good, although they charged him two dollars each for bacon and cheese on the burger, which is expensive when your burger is already $15. Not sure the bacon added anything, but the cheese, I'll admit was really good on this burger. 

Atmosphere and Service: Service was fine. BUT, since this seems to be a trend...or the gods are intent on making me detest children while eating out, we had another loud, rude child\/negligent parent situation (see post on Malaysian place). Another situation where children were screaming and running around and parents were sitting off, by themselves, ignoring them, while the rest of the people in the restaurant had to suffer. The group of older individuals across from us kept leaning over to make comments to us and the two ladies nearby grumbled under their breath. 

Once again, this was a problem that could easily have been solved by the restaurant. The kids were part of a party and were in a party room, which is adjacent, but separate from the rest of the dining room. This room had doors on it...which CLOSE, but were propped wide open. All the waitress had to do was go and quietly shut the doors. That's it! Problem solved. 

We were getting annoyed and so we didn't bother ordering dessert. Too bad, because they actually looked great. The group across from us ordered a few and were commenting on how good they were.

So yeah...I actually would have given this pub 2 stars even without the screaming kid, but if the screaming kid had not been a problem, we probably would have stayed for dessert and who knows, maybe these guys would be getting 3+ stars. That said, it just didn't do it for me. Overpriced, for only okay food and poor atmosphere."	2	1	0	['area', 'absolut', 'starv', 'crave', 'pub', 'fare', 'seem', 'fit', 'bill', 'especi', 'good', 'review', 'found', 'soso', 'decor', 'anoth', 'review', 'mention', 'decor', 'seem', 'miss', 'someth', 'agre', 'bore', 'booth', 'gap', 'seat', 'meet', 'wooden', 'bench', 'part', 'hold', 'seat', 'part', 'hard', 'describ', 'look', 'cheap', 'crappi', 'like', 'theyr', 'broken', 'tabl', 'unbalanc', 'waitress', 'came', 'stuck', 'coaster', 'would', 'stop', 'rock', 'small', 'cramp', 'food', 'select', 'pretti', 'standard', 'pub', 'fare', 'bit', 'expens', 'side', 'order', 'chicken', 'curri', 'dish', 'ask', 'want', 'spici', 'mild', 'ask', 'mild', 'either', 'mild', 'spici', 'would', 'hate', 'tri', 'actual', 'spici', 'made', 'mistak', 'curri', 'come', 'chicken', 'sauc', 'rice', 'sort', 'fri', 'crisp', 'nice', 'rice', 'bland', 'howeveror', 'spice', 'curri', 'kill', 'tastebud', 'husband', 'chose', 'burger', 'overal', 'good', 'although', 'charg', 'two', 'dollar', 'bacon', 'chees', 'burger', 'expens', 'burger', 'alreadi', 'sure', 'bacon', 'ad', 'anyth', 'chees', 'ill', 'admit', 'realli', 'good', 'burger', 'atmospher', 'servic', 'servic', 'fine', 'sinc', 'seem', 'trendor', 'god', 'intent', 'make', 'detest', 'children', 'eat', 'anoth', 'loud', 'rude', 'childneglig', 'parent', 'situat', 'see', 'post', 'malaysian', 'place', 'anoth', 'situat', 'children', 'scream', 'run', 'around', 'parent', 'sit', 'ignor', 'rest', 'peopl', 'restaur', 'suffer', 'group', 'older', 'individu', 'across', 'us', 'kept', 'lean', 'make', 'comment', 'us', 'two', 'ladi', 'nearbi', 'grumbl', 'breath', 'problem', 'could', 'easili', 'solv', 'restaur', 'kid', 'part', 'parti', 'parti', 'room', 'adjac', 'separ', 'rest', 'dine', 'room', 'room', 'door', 'itwhich', 'close', 'prop', 'wide', 'open', 'waitress', 'go', 'quietli', 'shut', 'door', 'that', 'problem', 'solv', 'get', 'annoy', 'didnt', 'bother', 'order', 'dessert', 'bad', 'actual', 'look', 'great', 'group', 'across', 'us', 'order', 'comment', 'good', 'wereso', 'yeahi', 'actual', 'would', 'given', 'pub', 'star', 'even', 'without', 'scream', 'kid', 'scream', 'kid', 'problem', 'probabl', 'would', 'stay', 'dessert', 'know', 'mayb', 'guy', 'would', 'get', 'star', 'said', 'didnt', 'overpr', 'okay', 'food', 'poor', 'atmospher']

We have driven by this place a million times and never given it a second glance, but based on the reviews, off we went to give it a try.

First impressions were pretty good. We were seated right away in a large booth. The restaurant was clean and modern looking, although covered in Halloween decorations, despite it being November 10. 

Menu looked pretty good, with lots of selection. The front of the menu is the desserts, which seem to be why most people come here. But we wanted dinner as well. I ordered the shrimp wonton soup and my husband ordered chicken and mushrooms with rice. 

We both ordered drinks. I ordered a tea and my husband ordered a mango smoothie. 

My drink came out...then my soup came out...neither of my husbands orders came. It took another fifteen minutes for his food to come and his drink came after that! No apologies for the wait. 

My soup was pretty basic. The noodles had no taste and a sticky texture. It was bland overall, but not terrible. My drink was good, but small, given the $6 price tag for a tea. 

My husbands dish was just gross. The chicken were little balls that looked like chicken fetuses. Maybe they were?? Filled with bones, making them very difficult to eat. The taste was bland and salty. 

His drink was good, but the straw didn't reach to the bottom of the glass...which wasn't a glass at all, but a wine decanter. He couldn't reach his drink about half-way through and had to borrow my straw.

We finished our meals and started waiting...and waiting and waiting. No one had come to check and see how our meals were and we had to flag someone down to clear the dishes. A girl finally came to go it and did so without looking, or asking if there was anything else she could get for us, or if we wanted refills. 

We REALLY wanted to give this place the benefit of the doubt, so we decided to stick it out and order dessert, since it seemed to be what this place was all about. 

We flagged someone down and ordered mixed fruit on a waffle. The presentation of the dish was certainly nice, but it's pretty generic. It's a basic belgian waffle with vanilla ice cream, strawberries, bananas and some melon balls and cool whip whipped cream on top and a sort of Aunt Jemima syrup. 

It was pretty good, but nothing special.

Once we finished we flagged someone down to get our bill. He said yes and left...and never came back. We saw his give other people bills and get food...he basically completely forgot about us. We waited for 15 minutes. We started looking around to figure out what happened and noticed that the wait staff were just chilling in the back of the restaurant. One girl was staring aimlessly at the ceiling. Two others were holding hands and swinging their arms in time to the music. Two guys were back there chatting away...it was actually weird. 

Finally, we managed to flag down yet a DIFFERENT waitress...this was number 6 (one seated us, one took our order, one cleared the dishes, one took the dessert order and one went to get our bill...apparently, and now this one) and asked her to get our bill. She finally did. We paid...we left a tip (we try hard not be be jerks, even if the service is poor) and left...never to return. 

So yeah, bland food, generic desserts and TERRIBLE service = not worth it.

My only criticism would be that the area for renting equipment is small and shabby and they (for some unknown reason) had to get our rental approved by management, I guess because we're a school, even though we're in the system and have rented many times before.

Since I have been several times and never had a bad experience, I can only give my review of this place based on what I have experienced. 

That said, it seems like so many people have experienced bad service, that even I am wary of this place now. I have never been during ""peak"" hours, which may account for more attentive service.

As mentioned, I have been to this restaurant several times and really enjoyed myself. I love Mexican food and there doesn't seem to be enough good Mexican restaurants around, so I get excited when I find one with food I enjoy.

I have had their nachos, two types of tacos and a burrito at this place and enjoyed all of them. When I went with a girlfriend, we were advised to get two taco plates and share them, since they give you a few, small tacos on each plate. We did this and really enjoyed both dishes. 

The nachos were also great, having been piled high with toppings, not just your grated cheese and some tomatoes. 

Drinks were also good. I guess my one criticism would be the price, which I do think is a little high given that Mexican food is quite cheap to produce. I am guessing that the extra cost goes towards the atmosphere, which is trendy...but I gave this same review to another Mexican restaurant I went to in Florida and it looked like someone's kitchen, so I guess it's all in the eye of the beholder."	2	0	2	['well', 'see', 'peopl', 'review', 'place', 'get', 'bad', 'rap', 'servic', 'sinc', 'sever', 'time', 'never', 'bad', 'experi', 'give', 'review', 'place', 'base', 'experienc', 'said', 'seem', 'like', 'mani', 'peopl', 'experienc', 'bad', 'servic', 'even', 'wari', 'place', 'never', 'peak', 'hour', 'may', 'account', 'attent', 'servicea', 'mention', 'restaur', 'sever', 'time', 'realli', 'enjoy', 'love', 'mexican', 'food', 'doesnt', 'seem', 'enough', 'good', 'mexican', 'restaur', 'around', 'get', 'excit', 'find', 'one', 'food', 'enjoyi', 'nacho', 'two', 'type', 'taco', 'burrito', 'place', 'enjoy', 'went', 'girlfriend', 'advis', 'get', 'two', 'taco', 'plate', 'share', 'sinc', 'give', 'small', 'taco', 'plate', 'realli', 'enjoy', 'dish', 'nacho', 'also', 'great', 'pile', 'high', 'top', 'grate', 'chees', 'tomato', 'drink', 'also', 'good', 'guess', 'one', 'critic', 'would', 'price', 'think', 'littl', 'high', 'given', 'mexican', 'food', 'quit', 'cheap', 'produc', 'guess', 'extra', 'cost', 'goe', 'toward', 'atmospher', 'trendybut', 'gave', 'review', 'anoth', 'mexican', 'restaur', 'went', 'florida', 'look', 'like', 'someon', 'kitchen', 'guess', 'eye', 'behold']

My sister had really hyped the tam-tams to me, so I went in a bit skeptical....but she was right! 

I can't really explain why this was so fantastic, especially because really it's a bit ridiculous. 

This is a big park and I don't know it well enough to direct people to where exactly you need to go, but by the large monument (the one featured on the picture for this attraction), you will find a group of drummers that set up here every Sunday. Depending on the day, there may be more, or less. Apparently the group can get pretty huge, but either way, they all gather around in a sort of circle...and drum! 

The environment is very ""come-as-you-are"" (read: hippy), but it's such a laid back and accepting atmosphere. The drummers just sort of jam together, playing all sorts of different types of drums and bongos. People go and dance in the middle...kids go and pound on the drums...lots of people get high! 

Even not high, this is a pretty fun thing to watch. It's mesmerizing somehow. Again, I can't explain what made this so great. We just sat back in the beautiful weather, snacked on our bagels and watched the craziness unfold around us.

My husband and myself went to Sail and were looking for a place to pick up some dinner...just grab and go, since I had no groceries at home...but also didn't have the energy to go grocery shopping. I lay in a hammock (I was in Sail, what else would I do?) I researched places to get sandwiches in the area and this place came up and had good reviews. I mentioned to my husband as we were checking out and the check out guy said, ""There is this good place nearby named Ricci's."" That sealed the deal. Off we went.

The outside is hardly something to look at. The sign is faded and dirty and it looks, outside, like it's a dive. We went in a saw a modestly busy place, clean and a HUGE menu. You can eat in (seating is limited and similar to fast food seating), can get delivery, or get take out. 

The menu is extensive, with pasta, pizza and panzerotti. We went with what many people were raving about online and got panzerotti...fried ones. OH GOD HEART ATTACK. We also got the rice balls.

Okay, rice balls first: Lightly breaded, gooey cheese on the inside and sauce for dipping them in....SO GOOD.

The panzerotti...well this is where they lose one star...not on the food itself, but because they messed up our order. One order was covered in a sheet of wax paper with the toppings listed on the inside...it was mine. But after a few bites I noticed, I was actually eating my husband's. We switched and then i noticed there were no toppings in mine at all! Just cheese and sauce. So they were mislabelled AND the order was messed up. 

But OH LORDY, was that a great panzerotti anyway. Just melt in your mouth awesome....and that's after a 30 minute drive home! 

I called up Ricci's and explained what happened and said I was too far away to come in again or to have something delivered and they gave me a credit for the panzerotti. The girl on the phone apologized and was very polite. So they fixed the problem to the best of their ability and it was amazingly delicious. Next time if I go back and the order it great...and not messed up, I think I'll have to bump these guys up another star!

Well my curiosity has been satisfied and I'm sure I'll never feel the need to visit this place again.

It struck me as a typical trendy place that yuppies feel they need to visit as all the other yuppies do.  
""Oh the food is sooo good!!""
""Really? You've eaten there?""
""No. But all my yuppy friends have and they say it's good so it must be.""

I only give it a two because the service and presentation of the food was decent.

We ordered something called oxtail fries which were horrible. I'm sure an actual oxtail would probably have been tastier.

My girlfriend and I each ordered a different burger so we could sample each others. Sorry I can't remember what they were called but we didn't care for either one. The best compliment I could pay them is to say they were at least edible.

So as mentioned the service was decent and the food looked presentable but as far as taste I can't recommend this place. 

Perhaps it's just me. Maybe the asian fusion just isn't my type of food.

I was a little concerned they'd be rushing us to finish our meal, so we arrived about 40 minutes early. I figured we could have a couple of drinks at the bar if they weren't able to seat us. Fortunately they were able to seat us right away.

Our waitress, Mettia, was awesome! Attentive and professional and friendly.

The ambiance was great.

The food was mediocre and we waited over an hour from when we placed our order for the food to arrive.

To be honest I haven't eaten in a Sonic in forever. So parking at one of their little ordering machines I got out of my car and was about to walk in because I didn't know if I could order food to go while parked at one of their ordering machines. Also I'm sure there is a better name then ""ordering machine""...maybe ordering station, vending space???? I'm sure if you've ever been to one you know what I'm referring to.

Anyway a young lady comes outside to tell me how a Sonic works. I could order from a machine outside to eat at one of their tables, or I could eat in my car while parked at one of their ordering stations, or they actually have a drive through.  I'm sure she must have wondered what was up with the ""old guy"" who didn't know how a fast food joint worked. Anyway she was kind and polite and did her best not to make me feel like a absent minded ""old guy""

Weighing my options I decided to use their drive through. I ordered a couple hot dogs. One mustard only and a Chicago style dog. A order of tater tots and a number 1 which is just a classic burger, fries and a drink.

As is typical for a fast food joint it was staffed with a very young group of people. What was not typical for a fast food joint is they actually got my order right.

Food was actually pretty good for a fast food joint.

It's a small place in a business district. The young tatted girl working the counter was polite and helpful.

I wanted to get a bottle of soda to go but they don't sell it by the bottle and I didn't want to spill it in my car on the way home. So I passed on the soda.

We found the entire meal to be okay. The ribs were very pink in the middle. I suppose some like it that way. But they were much more pink than we prefer.

Neither of us liked the mac and cheese. We found the macaronis to be way over cooked. We prefer them to have a little bit of firmness.

The cole slaw was the best part of the meal, although it was a bit dry. If there was a little slaw juice in with it it would be great!

The two guys working the front counter had the enthusiasm of a couple of rocks. It looked like it was an effort for them to even take a step. I understand it's probably not the best job in the world but there are people like me who recruit our employees from people we run into during our day to day activities. These two have zero chances of being recruited to work somewhere else.

I also had to ask for the fries that went with my combo. I got them, but only after a heavy sigh from one of the two at the counter. You would have thought I'd asked him to come outside and change my tire rather then just asking them for a bag of fries.

The food was mediocre, probably a three.

Upon looking up places in Vegas where I could purchase and learn about them I found this place.

I noticed several reviews mentioning they felt uncomfortable because the employees were keeping an eye on them. Well this is not the best part of town. And they are just trying there best to prevent theft.

At one point we were checking out one of the aisles and the owner, John, walked on over to check us out. I introduced myself and explained what I was looking for. He was a nice guy and we had a enjoyable short talk. All the time he was keeping his eye on some shady looking character in the store. I can't blame him.

I also saw mention of them being over priced. This may or may not be the case but he's trying to make a decent profit like all of us. If you know the price you want to pay and his stuff is to high then look elsewhere.

I'm in sales myself and it's been my experience that you can always find a cheaper product as well as a more expensive product.

I've been out here a half a dozen times over the years and have always loved this place.

It's not far from Vegas but due to it's lack of paved roads it doesn't get the type of visitation like RedRock Canyon or Mt Charleston. That's probably a good thing.

It's always been a great place to bring the dogs and let them off the leash to run around a bit. There were so few people no one seemed to care.

Well apparently that's changing I was out there today and there is a lot of construction going on. Looks like they're building a large visitor center.

What once was a large pond has been drained and the water is now in a large concrete pond.

What were once nice winding dirt paths can now best be described as winding sidewalks. It looked like hard concrete with dirt sprinkled on top.

And we were told twice by a park manager to keep our dogs on a leash. Guess this guy is instructed to snoop in the bushes and harass dog owners.

Oh well I know lots more beautiful places where no one harasses my dog.

It's still a lovely place and I'm sure non dog owners will love it."	4	1	1	['review', 'corn', 'creek', 'station', 'sort', 'like', 'gateway', 'desert', 'wildlif', 'nation', 'refugesort', 'visitor', 'center', 'half', 'dozen', 'time', 'year', 'alway', 'love', 'placeit', 'far', 'vega', 'due', 'lack', 'pave', 'road', 'doesnt', 'get', 'type', 'visit', 'like', 'redrock', 'canyon', 'mt', 'charleston', 'that', 'probabl', 'good', 'thingit', 'alway', 'great', 'place', 'bring', 'dog', 'let', 'leash', 'run', 'around', 'bit', 'peopl', 'one', 'seem', 'carewel', 'appar', 'that', 'chang', 'today', 'lot', 'construct', 'go', 'look', 'like', 'theyr', 'build', 'larg', 'visitor', 'centerwhat', 'larg', 'pond', 'drain', 'water', 'larg', 'concret', 'pondwhat', 'nice', 'wind', 'dirt', 'path', 'best', 'describ', 'wind', 'sidewalk', 'look', 'like', 'hard', 'concret', 'dirt', 'sprinkl', 'topand', 'told', 'twice', 'park', 'manag', 'keep', 'dog', 'leash', 'guess', 'guy', 'instruct', 'snoop', 'bush', 'harass', 'dog', 'ownersoh', 'well', 'know', 'lot', 'beauti', 'place', 'one', 'harass', 'dogit', 'still', 'love', 'place', 'im', 'sure', 'non', 'dog', 'owner', 'love']

I ordered a Hawaiian Pizza a order of wings and a bottle of Pepsi. The food was at my door quicker than any delivery I've ever had!

I'm very picky about wings. Most places seem way under cooked for my taste. These wings were great. My only complaint was they had just a bit two much sauce on them. I'd probably strain them next time just to let a bit of it drip off. But they were really tasty!

The pizza was great! So good in fact this is gonna be my new pizza place to order from.

Rather than drive all the way across town we opted to visit the one a little closer to us.

My girlfriends review is right below mine. Her name is Karen. Although it is very detailed and accurate. I'll add a few things. 

She gave it four stars so apparently she was a little more impressed than I was.

We each ordered one of their fancy drinks off of their drink menu. Both drinks were overly sweet and really just not that tasty. I do admit they both looked great and we did keep the souvenir glasses as they looked pretty cool.

I felt that the wait time for our food order was longer than needed. Strange as this is the same complaint I had about the one I visited yesterday.


I ordered the blackened chicken and she ordered the pot pie. As usual the portions are humongous. 

Both items arrived piping hot. All of this is good but again I found the food to be only satisfactory. It'll definitely fill you up and it was tasty enough. The presentation is terrific. ....... but again I just don't fell the urge to have to visit this place again.

I'd recommend other places before recommending this place.

The check was around $60.00..

Again we had a overall satisfactory experience. Good and hot food. Friendly staff. Clean environment.

Something just keeps me from giving this place more than 3 stars."	2	0	0	['ate', 'restaur', 'hotel', 'casino', 'yesterday', 'share', 'experi', 'girlfriend', 'anxiou', 'give', 'tryrath', 'drive', 'way', 'across', 'town', 'opt', 'visit', 'one', 'littl', 'closer', 'usmi', 'girlfriend', 'review', 'right', 'mine', 'name', 'karen', 'although', 'detail', 'accur', 'ill', 'add', 'thing', 'gave', 'four', 'star', 'appar', 'littl', 'impress', 'wasw', 'order', 'one', 'fanci', 'drink', 'drink', 'menu', 'drink', 'overli', 'sweet', 'realli', 'tasti', 'admit', 'look', 'great', 'keep', 'souvenir', 'glass', 'look', 'pretti', 'cooli', 'felt', 'wait', 'time', 'food', 'order', 'longer', 'need', 'strang', 'complaint', 'one', 'visit', 'yesterdayi', 'order', 'blacken', 'chicken', 'order', 'pot', 'pie', 'usual', 'portion', 'humong', 'item', 'arriv', 'pipe', 'hot', 'good', 'found', 'food', 'satisfactori', 'itll', 'definit', 'fill', 'tasti', 'enough', 'present', 'terrif', 'dont', 'fell', 'urg', 'visit', 'place', 'againid', 'recommend', 'place', 'recommend', 'placeth', 'check', 'around', 'overal', 'satisfactori', 'experi', 'good', 'hot', 'food', 'friendli', 'staff', 'clean', 'environmentsometh', 'keep', 'give', 'place', 'star']

I did use the restroom while here and found it to be clean and sanitary.

We both ordered our meals. I ordered the club sandwich, My girl ordered a gyro. Both meals came some sort of a thick chicken rice soup with a lemon taste. The soup was good until my girl discovered a hair in hers. That kind of turned me off on eating anymore of it. We let that slide cause a random hair can happen now and then.

The sandwich was very good as was the gyro. Both servings were very large and filling. Neither of us could finish them. The waitress, after learning we planned on being in Boulder City for awhile, offered to put the leftovers in the fridge for us to pick up later. We declined but it was nice of her to offer.

We had a few different servers attend to us - one for wines, one for our salad, and another for the rest of our needs.  I was blown away by the romantic setting, incredible service, and the impressive food!  As a vegetarian, your options are limited here, but never fear!  I had the vegetarian entree, which changes by the day.  When we went, it was mushroom ravioli, and oh wow.  It was SO good!  They were out of the raspberry cheesecake when we got to dessert, so we chose the berry tarte instead... I'm glad they were out of the cheesecake, because we wouldn't have gotten to try it otherwise!  (There are no words for how good it was.)  Everything about this experience was extremely positive.

But, unfortunately, my date was Completely ignored by the bartender when he went to get a drink.  He stood there 20 minutes(!!), with a $100 bill in his hand, all the while trying to get the guy's attention and watching others get served.  Finally my date told him he was the worst bartender he'd ever met.  Best part: the guy didn't even react.  Wow, Foundation Room.  Way to not impress.  Bottom line: go for the view.  If you're lucky you might not be ignored by the bartender."	1	1	1	['tempt', 'give', 'place', 'two', 'star', 'ill', 'explain', 'first', 'foremost', 'view', 'balconi', 'absolut', 'best', 'thing', 'place', 'offer', 'one', 'best', 'view', 'strip', 'possibl', 'get', 'date', 'got', 'free', 'ticket', 'go', 'enjoy', 'place', 'realli', 'cool', 'vibe', 'wellbut', 'unfortun', 'date', 'complet', 'ignor', 'bartend', 'went', 'get', 'drink', 'stood', 'minut', 'bill', 'hand', 'tri', 'get', 'guy', 'attent', 'watch', 'other', 'get', 'serv', 'final', 'date', 'told', 'worst', 'bartend', 'hed', 'ever', 'met', 'best', 'part', 'guy', 'didnt', 'even', 'react', 'wow', 'foundat', 'room', 'way', 'impress', 'bottom', 'line', 'go', 'view', 'your', 'lucki', 'might', 'ignor', 'bartend']

I've heard that this one has more than the other Vegas location, but my friend and I had to wait a few minutes to get a place to sit for two.  Other than that... the service was great.  I'm a vegetarian, and they let me swap out the meat that was on the menu for a side dish, so I was able to make my meal even more healthy.  It's a fun place, because they have two sides to the menu: ""Healthy"" and ""Happy"" (i.e., not healthy, haha!).  So, if you're friends with a super healthy person, or a super unhealthy person, there's something for either one!  I would say it's more on the expensive side, just for a small meal; but I enjoyed what I had, and definitely plan on coming back."	1	0	1	['downsid', 'place', 'think', 'need', 'seat', 'ive', 'heard', 'one', 'vega', 'locat', 'friend', 'wait', 'minut', 'get', 'place', 'sit', 'two', 'servic', 'great', 'im', 'vegetarian', 'let', 'swap', 'meat', 'menu', 'side', 'dish', 'abl', 'make', 'meal', 'even', 'healthi', 'fun', 'place', 'two', 'side', 'menu', 'healthi', 'happi', 'ie', 'healthi', 'haha', 'your', 'friend', 'super', 'healthi', 'person', 'super', 'unhealthi', 'person', 'there', 'someth', 'either', 'one', 'would', 'say', 'expens', 'side', 'small', 'meal', 'enjoy', 'definit', 'plan', 'come', 'back']

Pros: the food is delicious!  And with plenty of options (I'm vegetarian), there's a lot of tasty options to choose from.  They'll also let you sample something if you've never tried it.  I recently moved here from the Midwest, and had never eat cactus before.  (Turns out it's yummy!)  I had two burritos, and they were very good.

Cons: the food is given in very small portions.  Usually I don't complain about this because I'm a small person, and huge portions are usually a waste (or a doggie bag).  But I also have a healthy appetite, and found that one burrito was not enough.  So, if you've never been here, be on the safe side and order two of whatever you're thinking of ordering.  The tacos are even smaller, so maybe three.  And I'm talking about a normal person who's feeling an average hunger level.  If you're starving, please go elsewhere (haha).

All that being said, it's definitely worth going to.  This is Mexican food, made by people from Mexico - i.e., the way Mexican food Should be.  It's authentic.  If you're visiting Vegas, don't go to Taco Bell.  Please don't go to Taco Bell.

You can easily miss it, even looking for it, as my date and I did.  The service is also good.  The people who work there are really nice, so that's of course part of the five star rating.  It's Mediterranean, so it might go without saying that there are vegetarian options aplenty, but I won't let it go unsaid.  Please, just do yourself a favor.  Go here and try it out yourself.

Our server was very attentive, and our food was delicious.  They had some interesting vegetarian options, which is an absolute must for me.  If I can make it at home, why go to a restaurant and pay for it?  I had their ravioli, with a special sauce, nuts, and asparagus - very good.  I can't remember what my friend had, but he enjoyed his meal, as well.  For dessert, we decided on the tiramisu, and it was a good choice.

Often you'll have live bands playing on the stage, awesome street performers, and even Chippendale guys that pull you in for a sexy photo shoot.  Honestly, with all the very-scantily-clad girls, you might want to avoid this place if you have kids; between that and all the rampant cigarette smoking and drunk people, probably not a good idea to bring family here.  Also, a bad part of town is not far away, so best if you have company with you if you're a single lady.  I haven't tried the ziplining, but would like to at some point.  The overhead LCD screen sometimes has good shows, sometimes meh.  But, it's a quintessential part of Las Vegas history.  There are great restaurants, cool bars, and lots of unique vendors to experience, and they're different every single day.  So, never the same experience twice.

The appetizer we had (I can't remember what it was called - veggies breaded with various dipping sauces) was delicious, but they didn't have any eggplant parmesan left (that was the dish I really wanted).  So, I ordered a garlicky pasta dish.  It was tasty, but unfortunately I felt sick all night.  I know it wasn't the appetizer because the friend I dined with had no problems whatsoever.  Perhaps if I'd gotten the meal I wanted, I wouldn't have been sleepless until 5:30 am because I felt like I was going to throw up.  I've never had a bad experience at TCF before, so I'm going to view this as a fluke happenstance.

A truly fun and beautiful display!  This is definitely on my must-visit list every Christmas as long as I live here!  And, best of all, it's free to visit and meander through!

I have to be honest: I don't like chocolate, unless it's very dark chocolate.  That being said, the friend I visited with and I shared a couple of bars we bought, and they were both delicious.  It's cool that they let you see the actual factory where they make it, though I was disappointed because it wasn't really doing much of anything while I was there.

My friends and I had great service, they had a veggie burger, AND, their salads had easily THE best croutons I have ever had in Vegas.  Not your cheap, break-your-teeth croutons I dread with most salads; crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Oh man.  I am fangirling just remembering.  The veggie burger was also delicious.  (Then again, it's hard to go wrong with veggie burgers, since I've never met one I didn't like.)  Plus, they're open 24\/7, and the prices are good for Strip or near the Strip.

First of all, the waiting place is too small for all the people it struggles to accommodate, so you might get claustrophobic.  Also, though I know this isn't unique to this specific venue, not allowing someone to carry in their own water bottle - and then charging $5 for an average-sized water bottle - is ridiculous.  I've never had the alcoholic drinks there, but my friends have, and especially for the price, they were not impressive.  I highly recommend the shows here; just, don't come thirsty, hungry, or expecting to have much personal space.

I've seen movies here both in regular format, and 3D IMAX.  Really loved the IMAX.  The only thing I would criticize is that the seats in the theaters are often not clean, with food or junk debris all over the place.  The bathrooms were super gross when I went last time, and one door doesn't even have a latch on it.  I see other reviewers have also noticed these things, so apparently it's a consistent problem.

I love going in here, because everyone is so nice to me.  When I walked in for the first time, the owner greeted me right away, was very friendly, and showed me to a dressing room.  I had just bought a beautiful black dress, but it was slightly too long, needed straps shortened, a seam resewn, and a hook attached to the top of the zipper; for all of this work, it was $50.  They could have had it done same day, but since it was prom season and I didn't need it right away, I didn't push for that.  My dress now fits me absolutely perfectly, and all the work they did looks beautiful.  I'm so happy!  And, this might be a small thing, but, when I was about to leave, it started raining really hard, and they offered me a seat and a bottle of water while I waited for the rain to stop.

Sometimes, it's nice to go and get the flavor of a home-cooked Thai meal without having to make it yourself.

The food itself is so good.  I wasn't feeling daring, so I had their veggie burger - YUM!!  My friend and I also enjoyed their chips and bean-dip appetizer.

I have to admit, I wish she was singing live and not lip-syncing.  That's not too much to ask from a pop star who's been in the business for so long.  That being said, she, her dancers, and the set designers do a LOT to make you forget this vital fact, so it still manages to be a very entertaining show.  Lots of songs to sing and dance along to, that's one thing I loved about it, as well.

I also ordered a mojito - and, as I say, I've never met a mojito I didn't like; this one was particularly delicious!  Although there's a specific recipe on the menu, they'll flavor-infuse your mojito with any number of fruit options; I chose pomegranate, and it was Amazing.  The waitress was very friendly, provided recommendations for us, and was very attentive to us the entire time we were there.  I never got to the bottom of my glass of water (in my mind, a clear sign of great service!).  In addition, the street surrounding this restaurant is beautiful and intimate, especially at night; lights strung from tree to tree, brick street, and classy shopping and eating venues.

I have to admit, the security guards on the way out always make me feel a little uneasy.  I do understand what other reviewers have said about profiling, as I am a white, middle-class woman, and am hardly ever asked for my receipt.  BUT, most of the time, I use the self-checkouts, and the guards can probably see me conducting my checkout process, so that's probably also a factor.

In any case, it's pretty much your usual WMS.  I don't feel there's anything extra special about it.  I tend to go to the Neighborhood Market on Silverado because the workers are much more friendly and upbeat there.  I don't Expect niceness - I mean, after all, the pay is crap and I don't think they get any benefits.  I'd probably hate working there, too.  But, it's nice to find it when I can.  That being said, I've met plenty of nice and helpful workers at this branch, as well.

I ordered the medium cut prime rib cajun style.  It came out without the cajun seasoning, but that was quickly corrected.  The meat was done a little more than ordered, but not to the point it would dramatically affect the experience.  The meat was OK, not bad, not great.  The best part was the cajun seasoning.  It packed a lot of flavor and a nice kick.

Our server seemed overwhelmed and impatient.  He was short with us when we asked questions.

This is not a bad place, it just sets itself up for disappointment by including prime rib in the name."	2	0	0	['prime', 'rib', 'name', 'restaur', 'certain', 'expect', 'go', 'iti', 'tri', 'satay', 'appet', 'ok', 'best', 'dri', 'lack', 'flavori', 'order', 'medium', 'cut', 'prime', 'rib', 'cajun', 'style', 'came', 'without', 'cajun', 'season', 'quickli', 'correct', 'meat', 'done', 'littl', 'order', 'point', 'would', 'dramat', 'affect', 'experi', 'meat', 'ok', 'bad', 'great', 'best', 'part', 'cajun', 'season', 'pack', 'lot', 'flavor', 'nice', 'kickour', 'server', 'seem', 'overwhelm', 'impati', 'short', 'us', 'ask', 'questionsthi', 'bad', 'place', 'set', 'disappoint', 'includ', 'prime', 'rib', 'name']

Just like all other seafood joints they have other options.  The decor is cool and modern.  The service is solid.  It is quite expensive for what you get.  Part of that is because you are in Las Vegas, but at those price points I expect more.

For my meal I ordered the Cedar River Filet Mignon.  The filet comes with a red wine jus.  The filet was solid.  It was prepared as ordered.  The problem is I was expecting a $54 filet, and got a $35-$40 filet.  I had hoped for better flavor and texture.  It was by no means bad, it just did not live up to expectations.

For a side I chose the Old Bay Fries with remoulade.  The fries were ok.  The remoulade had good flavor.  Once again, for the price you want and expect more.

Overall this is a solid place.  My review will not help most as I did not eat any of the seafood options.

The horseradish dip had good flavor without being overwhelming. For my side I chose the truffle tater tots. I enjoy tots and truffles so it was an easy choice for me. The tots were solid.

As with all of their meals you get a large portion. You will not leave hungry. The flavors all combined nicely as did the textures. I was quite happy with my choice.

I make several trips to Las Vegas a year for work and I have stayed at many of the other casinos.  I had heard from many people that it was by far the best in Las Vegas.

It is not the best, but it is pretty good.  The guest rooms are large.  They are laid out quite well.  My room gave me a great view down the strip.  The floor to ceiling windows is a nice touch.  The rooms are nicely appointed through out.

The bathrooms are large.  I always enjoy the small flat screen television in the bathroom.  Several hotels do this now, but the television in my bathroom was loud enough for me to hear it while showering.  That simple fact made me happy.

The reason I did not give the Wynn five stars is the choice of patterns and colors.  I find them quite tacky.  I know I am in the minority in this, but I find the decor at the Venetian & Palazzo quite nicer.  The carpet in the hallways is brutal.

I am not a gambler so I can not say much to that.  There are several great food options.  Parking is easy.  I found a spot quickly and had a short walk to the guest room elevators.

I have many friends that always go the cheap route and stay at scary places like Excalibur and Luxor.  Trust me on this.  Spend the extra money and stay at a good hotel\/casino.

Our bartender and the manager were both attentive and took care of us while we waited. That is why they get three stars instead of one or two.

The first thing I tried was the Asadero Hash Brown. They are great. The textures and flavors are spot on. These are a very good side for any meal.

Next up were the Buffalo Chicken Sliders. These are exactly like they sound. No need for further description. The buns, meat and sauce are good. These  are a nice appetizer.

The last thing I tried was the Sticky Belly Steamed Buns. These are steamed buns filled with pork belly, Asian peanut slaw and green onion. They normally come with cilantro as well, but I hate cilantro so requested them without it.

If they can get the kitchen figured out we will certainly visit regularly during our Las Vegas visits."	10	6	8	['potenti', 'great', 'la', 'vega', 'hang', 'watch', 'game', 'lot', 'televis', 'bar', 'larg', 'lot', 'indoor', 'outdoor', 'seatingth', 'food', 'tasti', 'good', 'time', 'issu', 'time', 'took', 'get', 'food', 'patient', 'place', 'busi', 'far', 'past', 'accept', 'bartend', 'manag', 'attent', 'took', 'care', 'us', 'wait', 'get', 'three', 'star', 'instead', 'one', 'twoth', 'first', 'thing', 'tri', 'asadero', 'hash', 'brown', 'great', 'textur', 'flavor', 'spot', 'good', 'side', 'mealnext', 'buffalo', 'chicken', 'slider', 'exactli', 'like', 'sound', 'need', 'descript', 'bun', 'meat', 'sauc', 'good', 'nice', 'appetizerth', 'last', 'thing', 'tri', 'sticki', 'belli', 'steam', 'bun', 'steam', 'bun', 'fill', 'pork', 'belli', 'asian', 'peanut', 'slaw', 'green', 'onion', 'normal', 'come', 'cilantro', 'well', 'hate', 'cilantro', 'request', 'without', 'itif', 'get', 'kitchen', 'figur', 'certainli', 'visit', 'regularli', 'la', 'vega', 'visit']

Parking is easy whether you valet or self park. Check in is actually close to parking which is a big plus in a town where many casinos make you walk forever to get to anything. The elevators are also close to check in, another nice convenience. We checked in quickly and the staff was nice.

Our room was nice. They are good sized. You get a big bathroom, a good sized sleeping area and a big sitting area. The bathroom is nice. I appreciate that the toilet has its own door.

The sleeping area is nice. The beds are comfortable and there is plenty of drawers so you can unpack if you like. The sitting area is large. It includes a couch and a desk. The floor to ceiling windows give you nice views of the strip. The curtains are remote controlled which is convenient, as are the lights. It makes it easy to shut everything down at once when you are ready for bed.

Encore has a good sized casino floor. They were well staffed, so it was easy to find a seat at a table. They also have several great dining options from casual to fine dining. There are also some nice shops.

Our only issue was with the person restocking the mini bar. The cleaning staff did a good job of not bothering us when the do not disturb was up, but this guy ignored it two days in a row. Not a big deal, but an easy fix for them.

Check out was easy. I did it on the television and avoided the long line at check out."	10	4	6	['place', 'would', 'higher', 'list', 'locat', 'central', 'strip', 'locat', 'biggest', 'downfal', 'said', 'still', 'qualiti', 'place', 'staypark', 'easi', 'whether', 'valet', 'self', 'park', 'check', 'actual', 'close', 'park', 'big', 'plu', 'town', 'mani', 'casino', 'make', 'walk', 'forev', 'get', 'anyth', 'elev', 'also', 'close', 'check', 'anoth', 'nice', 'conveni', 'check', 'quickli', 'staff', 'niceour', 'room', 'nice', 'good', 'size', 'get', 'big', 'bathroom', 'good', 'size', 'sleep', 'area', 'big', 'sit', 'area', 'bathroom', 'nice', 'appreci', 'toilet', 'doorth', 'sleep', 'area', 'nice', 'bed', 'comfort', 'plenti', 'drawer', 'unpack', 'like', 'sit', 'area', 'larg', 'includ', 'couch', 'desk', 'floor', 'ceil', 'window', 'give', 'nice', 'view', 'strip', 'curtain', 'remot', 'control', 'conveni', 'light', 'make', 'easi', 'shut', 'everyth', 'readi', 'bedencor', 'good', 'size', 'casino', 'floor', 'well', 'staf', 'easi', 'find', 'seat', 'tabl', 'also', 'sever', 'great', 'dine', 'option', 'casual', 'fine', 'dine', 'also', 'nice', 'shopsour', 'issu', 'person', 'restock', 'mini', 'bar', 'clean', 'staff', 'good', 'job', 'bother', 'us', 'disturb', 'guy', 'ignor', 'two', 'day', 'row', 'big', 'deal', 'easi', 'fix', 'themcheck', 'easi', 'televis', 'avoid', 'long', 'line', 'check']

For my meal I had the philly cheese steak with truffle oil fries.  I love the flavor truffle oil gives fries.  They were great.  The cheesesteak was also pretty tasty.

For desert I had the tiramisu.  It was great.  The flavors were solid and distinct.  My friend had the cheesecake.  It was very good, and was a huge portion.

There is a good wine selection.

It is a bit pricey.  The cheesesteak was $24.  Most of the more formal meals were in the mid 40's.

The portions sizes are not conducive to large groups for sharing. The decor is cool. The room is quite dark. We were sat on time per our reservation. While the food is good, I think it is priced high for what you get.

Given the tapas style I was able to try several options.
Salt & Pepper Frites come with a garlic aioli, romesco dipping sauce. The fries have good flavor, and the sauce makes them even better. This is a good sharing option.

Mixed greens comes with prosciutto, pine nuts and a cider vinaigrette. This is not ideal for sharing, but the portion is good for one so that is ok.

We tried a few of the wood fired pizzas. They were all tasty. The crust had good texture and flavor. The sauce was tasty and the toppings were solid. These are great for sharing.

I also tried the Hand Cut Beef Carpaccio. It comes with petit watercress, shaved radish and garlic & parmesan aioli. This was a solid choice. It could have used a little more flavor, but was ok.

We have ate at the restaurants inside so many times, but had yet to visit Rose. Rabbit. Lie. It is buried deep inside Cosmo, just past the buffet. The decor is cool and quite unique. There is a big bar inside too if you have some time to kill before your reservation.

On top of the dining experience you get entertainment. Throughout our dinner there were various performances. There were singers and dancers. All of which were very good and entertaining. They do not perform non stop so you get plenty of time to still eat and talk.

They had a special Memorial Day Picnic themed option that night. It was pricey but it was designed to feed multiple people. When it came out we were shocked. They actually ended up pulling the table next to us to our table so they could make room for everything. The meal came with short rib on the bone, turkey sausage, beer can chicken, corn, mac and cheese and biscuits. I may have missed something, but you get the idea. They really did a great job with the presentation too. They put it on a huge platter and made it special.

All of the food was great. We both loved the short rib. The flavor was on point. The sausage and chicken were good too, but not on the level of the short rib. It was so tender and flavorful. The mac and cheese and corn were both very good. The biscuits, however, were great. Due to the immense size of our meal I did not get to enjoy more of them that night, but wow were they good.

I am comfortable saying the meal could have fed 4 people without a problem. We took the leftovers back to LA the next day and got two meals out of them.

We will certainly be back to try more of their regular menu items in the future. This is a great place to enjoy a meal and be entertained.

This casino is nearly to Stratosphere. That is ok if you do not intend to leave the casino much. They do have a stop on the monorail. That does help you get around, especially if you are attending an event at the convention center.

I got a great rate considering how many conventions were in town. Parking was relatively easy. They need to add signs in the parking garage that do a better job of pointing you to the casino entrance and check in. Check in was quick and painless. The front desk employee was friendly and helpful.

My room was small. The couch is at the foot of the bed, facing the bed and there is just enough room to walk around the bed on all four sides. The rooms is very modern. The bed and couch are made of plastic and are topped with cushions\/mattresses. You can turn on a light the lights the bed frame or couch frame from the inside. It is amusing for a few seconds. The bed was comfortable enough and it faces the window. The downside to facing the window is that the tv is mounted on a wall to the side of the bed so watching tv in bed is annoying.

The bathroom sink is in the bedroom area behind the headboard of the bed. The toilet is to one side of it with its own sliding door. The shower is on the other side with a similar sliding door. It is an odd set up, but not a deal breaker.

There are several very good dining options inside the casino. This is a definite plus. I did not get a chance to gamble on this trip, so I cannot speak to the casino floor activity. The casino is good sized and looked well put together.

Overall this is an ok option if you intend to stay here the entire trip or if you invest in a monorail pass.

Two of the people in our group ordered the hot burger that they give you a warning about before they let you order it.  Avoid this burger.  Not only is it blistering hot, it tastes horrible.

The wait was far too lengthy and the staff did not seem eager to fix that. The manager casually strolled around clearly not noticing the back up. The two staff members making the drinks seemed to be enjoying themselves, but in no hurry to get the job done.

After finally receiving my coffee I was then again disappointed. It tasted burnt and I could not detect any of the elaborate flavors in its description. Also please note that I waited that long for a coffee, not a latte or cappuccino.

I landed in one concourse of the A terminal and flew out of another within the same terminal.  I walked through the first and saw several food options which gave me hope for my options near my departure gate.  Unfortunately after my long walk to the other concourse I found there to be very limited options.  This I cannot understand.  Both concourses had a similar number of gates, yet one was loaded with options and the other completely lacked them.  Of course by the time i walked to my departure gate I did not have time to wander back to the other concourse, so I settled for a lesser option near my gate.

Just hope you do not have to change terminals or rent a car.  Either requires a bus trip.  That is a big pet peeve of mine.  At least you do not have to take a train like in Atlanta or Denver.

The last issue I will cover in this review is the fact that Southwest and US Airways hold most of the spots at this airport.

We were fortunate enough to get a seat by a window.  We were able to catch a glimpse of the strip and saw the fountain show at the Bellagio while we waited for our meal.

The food is very good.  I orderd the filet mignon medium rare with a blue cheese crust.  It was prepared perfectly and tasted great.  The food is ala carte so we ordered the onion brick and truffle oil fries for the table.  The onion brick was ok.  The fries were great.  I love fries prepared in truffle oil.

For my entree I chose the Cascabel Chile Crusted Rabbitt.  It was great.  It comes as a tenderloin and a leg.  The meat was tender, and the sauce added great flavor.  Even the toasted cous cous was tasty.

My room was not ready so she upgraded me to a much larger and nicer room. The problem is that the room probably is considered to be in another county. It was quite a walk. We went in Frank and Alberts for lunch. This was an odd experience. Four of us had meals with very small portions, and the other two meals were way too big of portions. The grilled cheese is an embarrassment to food, period. It is also a bit pricey for what you get. 

The room is nice but slightly dated. It had a 90's feel to it. This is OK in most hotels, but in a place like the Biltmore you can not let your rooms get that far behind. My room was huge. I had a full kitchen and living room area. 

There are several pools through out the property. The pool by my room was great because it was in a low traffic area. I was able to swim in peace any time of day. 

Parking can be a pain. I would recommend using the valet, but if your room is where mine was you have to walk over a 1\/4 mile to get to the valet.

You usually have to wait for a seat to open up, but it usually only takes a few minutes.  No issues with that.

I have only one issue.   It is the dealers.  They completely lack personality.  I have tried on multiple occasions and it does not matter who you get.   They rarely speak at all.  They just deal like robots.

If you do not plan to leave the casino much than this is a good choice.  The Rio and The Palms are also very good off-strip choices.

Pay attention to which tower you book.  That way you know which parking garage to use.  Otherwise you could have a mile long walk to your room at check-in.

We stayed in the Paradise Tower.  The rooms are average in size.  The decorations are modern with the obviuos rock style.  The beds are comfortable.

The casino floor is not that large, but there are some $5 tables for those on a budget.  There is a convenience store and a Starbucks inside.  There are a few decent places to dine.

The pool area is good.  There is even a small sandy beach area by the pool.  It would be nice if it was a bigger area, but it is fun none the less.  The pool area generally has a party atmosphere, especially on weekends.

As I said, if your goal is to spend any amount of time on the strip stay on the strip.  If you want to just hang out in the one place and party, then Hard Rock is for you."	2	0	0	['hard', 'rock', 'good', 'offstrip', 'casino', 'offstrip', 'part', 'also', 'greatest', 'neg', 'plan', 'leav', 'casino', 'much', 'good', 'choic', 'rio', 'palm', 'also', 'good', 'offstrip', 'choicespay', 'attent', 'tower', 'book', 'way', 'know', 'park', 'garag', 'use', 'otherwis', 'could', 'mile', 'long', 'walk', 'room', 'checkinw', 'stay', 'paradis', 'tower', 'room', 'averag', 'size', 'decor', 'modern', 'obviuo', 'rock', 'style', 'bed', 'comfortableth', 'casino', 'floor', 'larg', 'tabl', 'budget', 'conveni', 'store', 'starbuck', 'insid', 'decent', 'place', 'dineth', 'pool', 'area', 'good', 'even', 'small', 'sandi', 'beach', 'area', 'pool', 'would', 'nice', 'bigger', 'area', 'fun', 'none', 'less', 'pool', 'area', 'gener', 'parti', 'atmospher', 'especi', 'weekendsa', 'said', 'goal', 'spend', 'amount', 'time', 'strip', 'stay', 'strip', 'want', 'hang', 'one', 'place', 'parti', 'hard', 'rock']

The bar is large with a few different seating options. There are a few high minimum black jack tables inside. The decor and set up is cool. There are plenty of televisions to catch the game on.

They have a great selection of whiskey and scotch. There are several uncommon options of both, including several high end choices. The problem is the drinks are priced like a high end establishment, but the staff and clientele are not at that level. I get that it is impossible to control in a casino, but if I am going to pay for top shelf booze, I expect at least a minimum level of civility. I guess I am just getting old and grumpy.

The staff was nice, but not well versed in the fine selection they had available to them. I also overheard one of them telling a customer next to me he was not that good at mixing drinks. I guess at least he is at a whiskey bar so many of the drinks will be neat or on the rocks.

Later in the evening a DJ came in. She played a good selection of music, but clearly was playing a preset set list and was not mixing the songs at all.

Ok, no problem, we just went over to the bar for some drinks to burn some time. The problem though was the fact that we walked by several open tables that suited our group size. We just wrote it off to maybe being down a server. That was until they sat us forty minutes later at one of those very tables that was open when we walked in.

The bartender was good. He moved quickly and was on top of things. He also worked with our server to transfer our tab to our table. A simple thing that many places will not do so it was appreciated.

Our server at the table was also good. He came by often and was friendly. His visits got a little too space out toward the end, but overall it was good.

There are plenty of televisions to catch the game, or many games for that matter. There is a large bar area and a lot of regular seating as well. They had a live band in later in the evening. I am normally ok with this at a bar, but it confuses me at a sports bar. Especially with so many great 8pm games on. Also for whatever reason it was very warm inside. It was slightly crowded at times, but not enough to justify the excessive heat.

The food was ok. I ordered 8 boneless wings in the flaming Parmesan sauce. The sauce had decent flavor, but was certainly not flaming. The wings were large, but slightly over cooked. Not burnt, but overly crisp.

I also ordered the Steel Town Spuds with tater tots. You get a good sized portion. The tots come topped with ranch dressing, bacon, scallions and melted cheese. The flavor was ok.

Once you get into the actual building you wander through a hallway of shops that reminds you of a bad mall that is about to close for good.  First impressions mean a lot.  Clearly not a lot of thought was put into this.

Once you are off the escalator and into the lobby it gets much better.  The lobby area is huge and it looks good.  The elevators to the guest rooms are actually close to the lobby.  More casinos should be set up that way.

The rooms look nice.  They are good sized.  The bed is very comfotable.  The bathroom is quite nice.

My issue with the rooms is the television.  You can be operating a serious hotel of any kind with 27"" tube televisions.  This needs to be fixed.  Even the Tropicana now has 42"" hi def flat screens in most rooms if not all rooms.

I liked that there was a 24 hour shop right by the elevators.  It made it easy to get a cola or a snack any time of day since there was not a minibar in the room.

There are a lot of options for food.  From fast food to the only five star place for hundreds of miles.  It is a great idea to have multiple Starbucks.

The pool are is quite a walk from the hotel rooms.  It is a very nice complex.  It was nice to have at least one pool off to the side for adults only.  The service at the pool was good and there are a lot of lounge chairs.

The gaming area is nice and quite large.  There is a nice spread of minimums to fit most budgets.  Most of the dealers are friendly and helpful.

Inside, really not much different than the Atria's it replaced... except for the pics of Big Mike.  Had a couple of drinks at the bar and the bartender was quick, witty, and engaging although very busy.  Nice job!  We didn't get the V-Day special (2 meals for $100), but went for the separate meals.  Quick service, drinks were promptly brought to the table, as well as a bread basket which they even replaced for our take-home!  

Our server, Peggy, was prompt and on top of her game.  I started with a Caesar Salad which was really enough for 2 and was excellent.  Fresh and not too much dressing as they sometimes get. Timing was perfect between courses and the meals were very well done.  She got the twin lobster tails with asparagus and rice pilaf and I got the prime rib with a baked potato.  The tails were perfect and the rice pilaf was a bit different, but very fresh and not overly salty.  My prime rib was a bit on the rare side, which I usually order medium rare, and a bit unevenly cooked.  But the flavor and crust were phenomenal so that evened out to me.  Every bite melted in your mouth.  Never even used the au jus or horseradish sauce (which was a bit too bland for me, then again I used to grow my own!).  

We don't do dessert, but by the looks, and empty plates from those around us, they were excellent.  Chef came out to check on our table which is always nice and management staff was active and busy.... even helping to clear tables with smiles on their faces.  Not sure where the negative comments come from, but I've eaten in many fancier places and this stood right up to most of them.

I would like to thank you for renewing my hatred for your bland, artery busting Meximerican food. I hadn't experienced your brand of deep fried crap since I came of majority and stopped dined out with the family at restaurants that specialized in satisfying even the blandest of palettes. I must say, you continue to exceed my wildest expectations in that respect! I had to continue looking down at my plate just to make sure the 3,000+ calories I was consuming were more than just a mirage of Mexican food.

I will admit that I have a long standing, simmering hatred for you, Macayo's. So maybe this biases my opinion a bit. I can't in my right mind fathom why I thought you deserved a second chance last night. I think it's testament to the fact that sometimes I make super stupid decisions on an empty stomach, especially when I'm hungry enough to eat the ass end out of week dead burro. I suppose I was expecting something a bit more appetizing than that stretch of hyperbole. How wrong I was.

Your patio was the highlight of the evening. It's backed up against a lake and there was a duck that watched me eat. He had a shiny green head. It was nice. I made him my zen when all I wanted to do was lash out in frustration over the meal. If I could offer a suggestion to benefit both the duck and myself, perhaps you could pipe some music out onto the patio, because listening to Suzie and Sally Suburb bitch about their waistlines while committing refried sin was pretty grating.

The food however, far outshone those cackling soccer moms in terms of annoyance. I don't know who you think you are, Macayo's, but charging 10-15 bucks an entree at your establishment just about gave me a heart attack long before the lard had a chance to bully up on my arteries. Maybe it's because I think you have the street value of a gum job from a run down whore, but I have to say that those prices were shocking. I could travel the valley over and find better Mexican food for much cheaper. For that price, I expect outstanding quality and taste, or at least a hip see and be seen environment. All you have is a duck working in your favor. 

I do have a serious question for you though, what's with smothering your entrees in cream cheese and trying to pass it off as Baja sauce? It was the same jalapeno spread I get on my bagel in the morning, but with even less heat and flavor. I suggest renaming it Manhattan sauce in honor of the bagel and schmear capital of the nation, and I think it would be a touching homage to the Pace Picante ""New York City?!"" commercials. 

I also can't understand why the majority of your entrees offer either rice or beans, but few have these in conjunction. Those are universal standards at a Mexican food joint, and the ultimate test of quality since they're comparable the valley over. Do they bring you shame? Is that why you don't want to offer them both? Or are you just a cheap nickel and diming motherfucker, Macayo's? 

I'm more apt to believe the latter, because you charged me two bucks for guacamole without informing me that it cost extra. Then you delivered a pile of gelatinous green goop of questionable origin that had absolutely zero flavor. By this point in the meal I really shouldn't have been surprised at how bland everything was, because I was on to your ploy of substituting flavor for gobs of cream cheese and a heavy hand with the salt shaker. But despite stiff competition from the bland pico de gallo and the puzzling ""Baja sauce"", it was the shitamole took the grad prize of suckdom for the evening. I have never tasted weaker guac. You must have used some terrible avocados and whipped them with corn syrup or some other food-like filler. There wasn't a zing of cilantro or lemon juice, no hint of Serrano spiciness, not even the tang of some onion, although I did see a couple soggy tomatoes bits added for color. 

I don't think I will ever be coming back, Macayo's. It's not you, it's... I can't lie; even to spare your feelings. It's you. It's all you. I'm breaking up in a public setting because I'm scared that you'll key my car while by back is turned, or at the least smother it in cream cheese. I know you're into that freaky shit.

Wishing you deep fried broken dreams,

Unfortunately, with the corporate skullduggery muscling out the competition and brainwashing America to embrace the familiar mediocrity of preformed, seasoned sawdust, they're few and far between. I mean, if I want a microwaved meal the same 50 states over, I'd go to Applechilidennybee's. If I want some down home, from scratch, mama couldn't have made it better cookin', I'll go to Cindy's. 

Being a small business, the decor is a little hokey. They're not spending money on some razzledazzle, flash and awe marketing flare. (They have ads embedded into the varnish of their table tops, people! They're selling dining space for revenue! Just so they can keep their entrees cheap as sin!) We sat in a room that was a shrine to John Wayne, big enough to accomodate our 8 person group. There were no less than ten pictures of The Duke. (That includes four duplicates of that wacky picture where the scale of his hat is off and it cuts into his head about an inch.) And to top it all off, there was a mirror running the length of the other side of the room, ensuring that double The Duke stared down at us as we ate. Weird.

But what this little place lacks in ambiance, it makes up for in food. I had a tuna melt on rye that was to die for. Anyone who knows me can vouch for the fact that I believe the tuna melt to be a sandwich of the gods. Fuck ambrosia. They were eating warm albacore over buttery, crisp bread, smothered in cheddar cheese and pan fried to perfection. And the fries were sprinkled with some kind of magic pixie dust that endowed them with the ability to make me profusely salivate.

Everyone at the table ordered something different (from the hot roast beef dinner to the fried fish, Caesar salad to the pork fritter sandwich) and it was agreed that all entrees were wicked, fricken good. And breakfast is served all day long. Super score!

So go, pay homage to John Wayne, and he shall reward you with some good eats!"	10	8	4	['realli', 'dig', 'good', 'ole', 'mom', 'pop', 'greasi', 'spoon', 'dinerunfortun', 'corpor', 'skullduggeri', 'muscl', 'competit', 'brainwash', 'america', 'embrac', 'familiar', 'mediocr', 'preform', 'season', 'sawdust', 'theyr', 'far', 'mean', 'want', 'microwav', 'meal', 'state', 'id', 'go', 'applechilidennybe', 'want', 'home', 'scratch', 'mama', 'couldnt', 'made', 'better', 'cookin', 'ill', 'go', 'cindi', 'small', 'busi', 'decor', 'littl', 'hokey', 'theyr', 'spend', 'money', 'razzledazzl', 'flash', 'awe', 'market', 'flare', 'ad', 'embed', 'varnish', 'tabl', 'top', 'peopl', 'theyr', 'sell', 'dine', 'space', 'revenu', 'keep', 'entre', 'cheap', 'sin', 'sat', 'room', 'shrine', 'john', 'wayn', 'big', 'enough', 'accomod', 'person', 'group', 'less', 'ten', 'pictur', 'duke', 'includ', 'four', 'duplic', 'wacki', 'pictur', 'scale', 'hat', 'cut', 'head', 'inch', 'top', 'mirror', 'run', 'length', 'side', 'room', 'ensur', 'doubl', 'duke', 'stare', 'us', 'ate', 'weirdbut', 'littl', 'place', 'lack', 'ambianc', 'make', 'food', 'tuna', 'melt', 'rye', 'die', 'anyon', 'know', 'vouch', 'fact', 'believ', 'tuna', 'melt', 'sandwich', 'god', 'fuck', 'ambrosia', 'eat', 'warm', 'albacor', 'butteri', 'crisp', 'bread', 'smother', 'cheddar', 'chees', 'pan', 'fri', 'perfect', 'fri', 'sprinkl', 'kind', 'magic', 'pixi', 'dust', 'endow', 'abil', 'make', 'profus', 'salivateeveryon', 'tabl', 'order', 'someth', 'differ', 'hot', 'roast', 'beef', 'dinner', 'fri', 'fish', 'caesar', 'salad', 'pork', 'fritter', 'sandwich', 'agre', 'entre', 'wick', 'fricken', 'good', 'breakfast', 'serv', 'day', 'long', 'super', 'scoreso', 'go', 'pay', 'homag', 'john', 'wayn', 'shall', 'reward', 'good', 'eat']

We both love Scooby Do's. They treat my little butt-faced dog like a prince and are receptive to correcting anything about the cut that I perceive as being weird. Like that funny poofy pompadour. Mohawk it out, yo. Done. In like five seconds my little man was looking fabulous and bad ass. Not something easily accomplished with a prancing pup that literally chases butterflies through tall grasses. (He ended up looking like a little lamb as the cut grew out too. So adorable.)

The shampoo they use here is also amazing. Noodles usually smells like tacos (a combination of beef stank and corn chips) but after getting back from the Do's, he smelled like Christmas morning! Sugar and spice and everything nice instead of frogs and snails and puppy dog tails. He's got some gender identity issues to deal with. 

The pricing is also cheaper than some of the big name conglomerates out there. I'm talking to you Petsmart! I've taken my other pup to Smelly Dog before, but unless I need dog sitting play time after the cut, I'll go with Scooby's.

The braised oxtails are heavenly, succulent and fall off the bone tender. They had me audibly moaning with delight the entire meal. The plantains and braised cabbage on the side were perfect sides, and the rice with pigeon peas was perfect for sopping up all that oxtail sauce. 

The jerk chicken was also fantastic, but since I was so busy hoarding my oxtails I didn't get to try much of it. The jerk was smoky, spicy, and highlighted the chicken instead of overpowering it. Same sides, so at least we didn't have to fight over those. 

Make sure to try the hibiscus flower drink (sorrel) with cloves floating in it. It accompanies the earthy, spicy flavor palate of the meat well and is very similar to the jicama offered up at Mexican joints.

The atmosphere of this place is wonderfully warm and inviting. The eclectic and bold paint decorating the walls is very reminiscent of the Caribbean, and the faux-rattan chairs help with the vibe too. There's also a couch against one side of the restaurant that is kind of out of place, but who am I to judge decor? Nothing in my house matches. 

In that respect it's kind of like being invited over to a friend's house for dinner and having her mom whoop up some of the most amazing ethnic food you never get at your Kraft mac n cheese house. It's clearly a family owned joint with all ages bumming around the kitchen. Kiddos bring out water, adolescents with hip hop ring tones take your order, and the matriarchs keep them all in line. It's energetic and engaging and utterly delicious. 

Next time I need leave room for the cassava or coconut cake! (Much harder to do than you may think. Trust me.)

Oh, they also have some interesting breakfast options like smoked fish and such. Don't worry, they also have regular old eggs on the menu.

It was my father's birthday and I couldn't think of a thing to get the most unhelpful man ever. ""Whatta you want? Whatever. Like what? You don't have to get me anything."" Oh, but I do.

My beacon of hope was tucked away in a tiny little strip mall, sandwiched by a Dunkin' Donuts, a Japanese food mart and a liquor store, with a simple sign advertising, ""Irish Gifts."" Salvation! He's all about heraldry and Irish pride, but would the offerings be too chotchke to actually give anyone? Like leprechaun print boxers and Kiss Me I'm Irish ties he'd only wear one day during the year? 

Nope. This place is a class act. 

When I first entered the store I was shocked at how much stuff they had crammed onto the floor space. It would have been claustrophobic had they not utilized barriers (also decorated with stuff) that lead you into different areas of the store. The owners also run the place and immediately greeted me. 

I was pleasantly surprised at the wide variety of Irish themed offerings. They had everything from the goofy offerings I had imagined to beautiful jewelry, china and crystal ware. They even had a whole section of imported Irish food, including tea, sweets and refrigerated stuff like sausages. He ended up with some glassware with decorative pewter insignias ranging from Celtic knots to Claddagh rings. 

The people who own it are friendly and immediately helpful in finding anything you need, ordering what they don't have or calling the competition to see if they can secure that special something, something I appreciate. I've been frequenting the place since, snatching up Guinness themed merchandise for friends and fun Irish gifts for other members of my family. My dad even purchased his wedding rings from the place and a lovely Celtic cake topper of a man and woman with knot work circling it.

The prices are a wee bit steep, but they won't have your wallet crying out in protest. And for imported goods at a specialty shop, it's completely understandable. 

Don't forget to sign up for the Shamacus (shamrock-cactus! nyuk, nyuk!), a newsletter that arrives quarterly or so with all sorts of recipies, stories, and specials on their merchandise.

Granted, the beer here blows Four Peaks out of the water, but I'd much rather have a nice cocktail than chew though a specialty brew. But if beer is your poison of choice, they've got just about everything. The happy hour is kind of weak here though, with like a buck off all drafts. Thoroughly meh.

You can peruse the coolers and grab a cold one or choose from 20+ drafts they have on the menu. No Bud Light here though. Sorry frat chumps. They used to have a ton of wine here as well (like, ages ago) but it has since been narrowed down to just four choices, none of which were calling my name this last go round. Their Orange Blossom wheat beer was a bit like drinking an orange creamsicle in beer form. Almost like a cider with floral notes, a light finish and a super creamy mouthfeel. (Oh yeah, bitches. I just went there.) The perfect beer for the novice drinker to enjoy. Their IPA was also pretty decent, but was more bitter than I care for, although it stayed far away from feeling like I was drinking a bottle of grassy perfume. Solid.

I thought they had deals on happy hour food (again, like a buck off) but last time I went it was no dice. At least the food's reasonably priced. Tasty rueben, craptastic hummus, crispy quesadilla. 

The acoustics in this place are kind of shitty, so go on an off time when it won't be packed, or run the risk of smiling and nodding amicably while hearing every other snippet of convo. The high top tables are also really uncomfortable for shorties like me to sit at, but c'est la vie. My biggest peeve about this place is the gigando assy television against the wall.

Admittedly, I was a little drunk on crappy bowling beer by the time we got here, but I had an absolute blast. There might also have been darts, but when I'm seeing double bull's-eyes it's unlikely I'm going to be getting many double bull's-eyes, so the option entered and left my brain pretty quick.

The stand out decorations were a painting of a tarted up cartooney monkey in the women's bathroom and two creepy mannequins, a flannel clad lumberjack and a tomahawk carrying ""chief."" Granted, it's probably not politically correct, but it's definitely perplexing and helps drive home the fact that Uncle Monkey's doesn't give a flying fuck about catering to anyone that doesn't fit the dive bar mold. It's dark, weathered, kinda dingy and it exists for the express purpose of getting' you loaded, and the patrons reflect this fact by looking a little frayed around the edges as well.

The one issue I had with the place is the fact that it's hidden away in the corner of a non-descript strip mall with no sign on the front, so if you don't know about this place, you're unlikely to be finding yourself sharing a drink with the yokels."	19	17	9	['geek', 'dont', 'know', 'realli', 'like', 'establish', 'word', 'monkey', 'name', 'tickl', 'pink', 'adolesc', 'level', 'like', 'nut', 'shot', 'firework', 'uncl', 'monkey', 'bar', 'start', 'advantag', 'definit', 'dive', 'bar', 'dont', 'go', 'expect', 'someth', 'fanci', 'schmansi', 'got', 'monkey', 'bar', 'name', 'peopl', 'pretti', 'much', 'tell', 'everyth', 'need', 'know', 'await', 'insidecash', 'cheap', 'alcohol', 'buck', 'three', 'shot', 'jameson', 'one', 'fifti', 'well', 'stiff', 'drink', 'pool', 'tabl', 'decent', 'jukebox', 'pretti', 'much', 'need', 'satisfi', 'littl', 'barfli', 'admittedli', 'littl', 'drunk', 'crappi', 'bowl', 'beer', 'time', 'got', 'absolut', 'blast', 'might', 'also', 'dart', 'im', 'see', 'doubl', 'bullsey', 'unlik', 'im', 'go', 'get', 'mani', 'doubl', 'bullsey', 'option', 'enter', 'left', 'brain', 'pretti', 'quickth', 'stand', 'decor', 'paint', 'tart', 'cartooney', 'monkey', 'women', 'bathroom', 'two', 'creepi', 'mannequin', 'flannel', 'clad', 'lumberjack', 'tomahawk', 'carri', 'chief', 'grant', 'probabl', 'polit', 'correct', 'definit', 'perplex', 'help', 'drive', 'home', 'fact', 'uncl', 'monkey', 'doesnt', 'give', 'fli', 'fuck', 'cater', 'anyon', 'doesnt', 'fit', 'dive', 'bar', 'mold', 'dark', 'weather', 'kinda', 'dingi', 'exist', 'express', 'purpos', 'get', 'load', 'patron', 'reflect', 'fact', 'look', 'littl', 'fray', 'around', 'edg', 'wellth', 'one', 'issu', 'place', 'fact', 'hidden', 'away', 'corner', 'nondescript', 'strip', 'mall', 'sign', 'front', 'dont', 'know', 'place', 'your', 'unlik', 'find', 'share', 'drink', 'yokel']

It used to be a tiny, homey little cafe next to Long Wong's at 7th Street and Mill and has since been converted into a spacious, classy winery and Italian bistro at 4th Street and Mill.

Happy hour specials are only extended to the bar area, which is tiny in comparison to the rest of the area. There's the traditional happy hour from 5 to 7, and a reverse happy hour that begins after 10 pm. (Check which days this is available though, because I'm not sure it's daily.) Draft beers like Guiness and Harp are two bucks, wine by the glass is half off (3 to 6 bucks after the discount), as are their fancy pants cocktails (generally 5 bucks)--the espresso martini is decadent--and all appetizers aside from the huge cheese plate are half priced. One wonky thing about the tab for happy hour is that they take the discount off at the end, so just keep a running tab in your head of how much you owe if you're with a group to make things go a little smoother.

I'm in lust with the Shrimp Adriatico, which is an appetizer that has five big tiger shrimp swimming in garlic tomato sauce that's served with a loaf of bread for dipping. It's filling enough to serve as an entire meal, or to share among friends.

On Sundays, pitchers of sangria are half priced ($15 instead of $30) and are a refreshing way to relax with a group of friends in the afternoon. I prefer the white wine over the red because it compliments the freshly sliced apples and muddled citrus. Make sure to ask them to go easy on the cinnamon though, or you may end up with an overpowering flavor and chalky texture.

Dinner is always divine as well, but a little bit on the pricey side. The meals are huge though, so you're pretty much guaranteed leftovers or you can split an entre with another person for an extra 3 buck charge. The Voodoo Penne is a delicious Cajun flavored dish, Lucas' Meatballs are savory and filling, and the Pola Pola is some awesome artichoke ravioli. Everything is done well and I rarely encounter problems with the servers or bartenders.

It's a nice, mellow break from the hubbub of Mill Avenue.

***UPDATE***
I've been a little peeved lately at the happy hour, since it's only extended to the bar and the bar is so damn tiny. Now I understand that if I don't get there around 5 I have no chance of getting a seat. That's fine. But the damn Chase employees get there around 4:30 (before Happy Hour even starts, where's the logic in that?) and hog all the damn seats, leaving me with nothing but shattered hope and an empty glass. You better shape up, Caffe Boa, or I'm docking a star!
***UPDATE***
You've been docked a star Boa. You went and increased the prices of your entrees by three bucks at the very least. Fuck you and your scrumtious, mouth watering 19 dollar spaghetti and meatballs. They're fucking meatballs, Boa! Plus your half price on glasses of wine less than 10 bucks is a pretty useless deal now. Jeezy creezy.

This isn't goodbye though. I'll still chill with you on Sundays for the sangria, but I shall never indulge in the pola pola, voodoo penne or your shitty Willow Bakery bread again.

Based on experience, if I cart my lazy ass down to the Fry's at Thomas and 44th, I end up spending about 1\/4 less on my shopping trip than I do at this Safeway. Everything is ridiculously expensive, even after the ""club card"" savings. 

I have no idea why. Is it because it's in Arcadia? Is it the added expense of upkeep involved in over-stocking the wine section, or the fancy olive bar, or the gourmand cheese selection? Or maybe it's the added cost of employing cashiers by not installing self-check out lanes. Do I really have to stand in line for ten minutes behind a suburbanite with 2.5 screaming childes just to buy a couple sticks of buttah? 

And I understand carding, but do you really have to whip out the book to copy down my info and then make me sign my name like three times because my 16-year old self's signature doesn't match my 27 year-old scrawl? Come on, now. That's excessive. I appreciate that you think I'm looking foxy young for my age, but I'd rather hit up the crack pipe-selling liquor paloozas along McDowell than deal with this nonsense.

Unless I am in desperate need of an ingredient *stat* or require something special like their amazing Mediterranean olive selection, I'm staying far, far away."	1	7	1	['live', 'stone', 'throw', 'safeway', 'never', 'end', 'groceri', 'base', 'experi', 'cart', 'lazi', 'ass', 'fri', 'thoma', 'th', 'end', 'spend', 'less', 'shop', 'trip', 'safeway', 'everyth', 'ridicul', 'expens', 'even', 'club', 'card', 'save', 'idea', 'arcadia', 'ad', 'expens', 'upkeep', 'involv', 'overstock', 'wine', 'section', 'fanci', 'oliv', 'bar', 'gourmand', 'chees', 'select', 'mayb', 'ad', 'cost', 'employ', 'cashier', 'instal', 'selfcheck', 'lane', 'realli', 'stand', 'line', 'ten', 'minut', 'behind', 'suburbanit', 'scream', 'child', 'buy', 'coupl', 'stick', 'buttah', 'understand', 'card', 'realli', 'whip', 'book', 'copi', 'info', 'make', 'sign', 'name', 'like', 'three', 'time', 'year', 'old', 'self', 'signatur', 'doesnt', 'match', 'yearold', 'scrawl', 'come', 'that', 'excess', 'appreci', 'think', 'im', 'look', 'foxi', 'young', 'age', 'id', 'rather', 'hit', 'crack', 'pipesel', 'liquor', 'palooza', 'along', 'mcdowel', 'deal', 'nonsenseunless', 'desper', 'need', 'ingredi', 'stat', 'requir', 'someth', 'special', 'like', 'amaz', 'mediterranean', 'oliv', 'select', 'im', 'stay', 'far', 'far', 'away']

It's a must try for a unique brunch\/lunch\/dinner\/whatever experience in the valley! I'm reluctant to review this place since I don't want to wade through patrons on my way to another lovely Sunday brunch, but my taste buds will not be deterred. (Plus I have until September before they re-open, so there's plenty of buffer room.)

It's an impromptu fly-by-the-seat-of-whatever-the-chef-feels-like-whipping-up type place. The kind of place where you show up to breakfast and are asked one question: Sweet or savory? 

So whatever you do, leave those picky eater at home! When it comes to dinner, you don't want a wonderbread palate (""Um, I don't eat anything green..."") influencing the meal. Chef Christopher is a dynamo in the kitchen, and you need to leave that one man show plenty of room to create his masterpieces. No exaggeration, his dishes are crazy delicious masterpieces. It's like having your own personal top chef customizing something just for you.

The fact that this place is BYOB makes my heart smile. I love sharing a couple bottles of good wine or champagne among friends over dinner, and the fact that I don't have to pay a restaurant mark-up is ideal. He's also cool with you brining in some orange or cranberry juice for  DIY mimosas in the morning. There's a $10 corking fee, but considering the fact that a glass of wine is often more expensive than that, it's a screaming deal. 

Be forewarned that this is a dining experience rather than a quicky meal. A much more European approach to lingering and enjoying the food, drink and atmosphere. It will take you a couple hours to get through everything from initial seat and greet with the chef (who doubles as the waiter\/busser\/todos!) to your last scrumptious bite. Totally worth every minute of waiting. Also, you might not want to come here starvin marvin. And definitely don't invite anyone you can't stomach hanging out with for a couple hours. 

Let's wrap it up:
-Don't bring picky eaters.
-Don't come so hungry that you'd eat the ass end carpaccio out of fresh roadkill.
-Don't bring socially awkward schmoes that will suck all the fun out of the room because you've got to be around that for hours, man. Hours.
-Do BYOB, and don't be afraid to bring a mixer for mimosa fun.
-Do bring cash only, and tip very, very well. (He deserves it!)

I now set you forth upon the world with the knowledge necessary to enjoy all that Cafe Monarch has to offer.

Now I understand that's not the most helpful assessment, so I'll elaborate to save you from ending up at this crap hole should you think, ""Oh Erica, you must have just been cranky that day!"" Not so.

It all started when I had a craving for hummus earlier this week. I work too far from just about every hummus slinging place in Tempe but Byblos. So I decided to try something new, and was left with a sour taste in my mouth.

First off, the place is located in a shitty plaza of decaying shops (home to the Yucca Tap Lounge if that's any indication) and it's right next door to a Mexican food restaurant that I've never seen anyone enter or leave, so it looks like a front for some shady 'business' dealings. But my craving would not be deterred by a craptastic plaza, after all, Capistrano's is in the same plaza and it's delicious. Looks aren't everything. Hummus would be had.

We enter. It's empty and dumpy looking. The only people here have a mean age of 70. We significantly bring this average down. Waaaay down. We are escorted to a table and peruse the menu. The server (I assume it's the unfriendly server you had, Kelly B., because he looked like he had a stick up his ass that had been festering there for the past 60 years) took our drink orders and came back with two itsy bitsy little cups. Seriously? You're going to charge me 2.50 for six ounces of lemonade? We order. He frowns for the umpteenth time in our short interaction and waddles off to the kitchen. The food arrives.

The hummus was straight up GROSS, and the pita bread was shockingly similar to cardboard. The hummus tasted sour with a texture that was a combination between chalk and paste. If I can corner a five year old, I'm going to conduct a taste test between the two substances and see if there's any discernable difference. My money's on no. The presentation was nice, with pickles, tomatoes, olive oil and parsley, but if I wrap a piece of dried up dog shit in ribbons and bows, your gift would still be a piece of dried up dog shit. Maybe you could use it as a paper weight? 

The tomato soup that came along with lunch was pretty decent,and the gyro meat was well spiced. But the fact that my gyro was wrapped in the aforementioned cardboard pita bread was really unappetizing. It's like they took rock hard, stale pita bread, heated it in the microwave to make it pliable, molded it and let it cool in its rigid formation. 

So if you're 70 and your senses are slowly numbing, you might like this place. Other than that, stay away. It's unwelcoming and unappetizing. The antithesis of what a restaurant should be. Let it slowly decay along with the rest of the shops lining this creepy little plaza at the corner of Mill and Southern."	12	16	7	['place', 'sucksnow', 'understand', 'that', 'help', 'assess', 'ill', 'elabor', 'save', 'end', 'crap', 'hole', 'think', 'oh', 'erica', 'must', 'cranki', 'day', 'soit', 'start', 'crave', 'hummu', 'earlier', 'week', 'work', 'far', 'everi', 'hummu', 'sling', 'place', 'temp', 'byblo', 'decid', 'tri', 'someth', 'new', 'left', 'sour', 'tast', 'mouthfirst', 'place', 'locat', 'shitti', 'plaza', 'decay', 'shop', 'home', 'yucca', 'tap', 'loung', 'that', 'indic', 'right', 'next', 'door', 'mexican', 'food', 'restaur', 'ive', 'never', 'seen', 'anyon', 'enter', 'leav', 'look', 'like', 'front', 'shadi', 'busi', 'deal', 'crave', 'would', 'deter', 'craptast', 'plaza', 'capistrano', 'plaza', 'delici', 'look', 'arent', 'everyth', 'hummu', 'would', 'hadw', 'enter', 'empti', 'dumpi', 'look', 'peopl', 'mean', 'age', 'significantli', 'bring', 'averag', 'waaaay', 'escort', 'tabl', 'perus', 'menu', 'server', 'assum', 'unfriendli', 'server', 'kelli', 'b', 'look', 'like', 'stick', 'ass', 'fester', 'past', 'year', 'took', 'drink', 'order', 'came', 'back', 'two', 'itsi', 'bitsi', 'littl', 'cup', 'serious', 'your', 'go', 'charg', 'six', 'ounc', 'lemonad', 'order', 'frown', 'umpteenth', 'time', 'short', 'interact', 'waddl', 'kitchen', 'food', 'arrivesth', 'hummu', 'straight', 'gross', 'pita', 'bread', 'shockingli', 'similar', 'cardboard', 'hummu', 'tast', 'sour', 'textur', 'combin', 'chalk', 'past', 'corner', 'five', 'year', 'old', 'im', 'go', 'conduct', 'tast', 'test', 'two', 'substanc', 'see', 'there', 'discern', 'differ', 'money', 'present', 'nice', 'pickl', 'tomato', 'oliv', 'oil', 'parsley', 'wrap', 'piec', 'dri', 'dog', 'shit', 'ribbon', 'bow', 'gift', 'would', 'still', 'piec', 'dri', 'dog', 'shit', 'mayb', 'could', 'use', 'paper', 'weight', 'tomato', 'soup', 'came', 'along', 'lunch', 'pretti', 'decentand', 'gyro', 'meat', 'well', 'spice', 'fact', 'gyro', 'wrap', 'aforement', 'cardboard', 'pita', 'bread', 'realli', 'unappet', 'like', 'took', 'rock', 'hard', 'stale', 'pita', 'bread', 'heat', 'microwav', 'make', 'pliabl', 'mold', 'let', 'cool', 'rigid', 'format', 'your', 'sens', 'slowli', 'numb', 'might', 'like', 'place', 'stay', 'away', 'unwelcom', 'unappet', 'antithesi', 'restaur', 'let', 'slowli', 'decay', 'along', 'rest', 'shop', 'line', 'creepi', 'littl', 'plaza', 'corner', 'mill', 'southern']

Granted it's only been open for a month or so, but since it's their third location I doubt the menu will change any time in the future and that's really my gripe. 

Carne asada and al pastor pork. 

That's it. 

They'll serve it in just about any iteration of a ""tortilla + meat"" that Taco Bell has dreamed up six times over, but fact is you're stuck with either carne asada or al pastor.

Needless to say the meat should be mind blowing to carry such a limited menu. It was solid, but nothing to write home about. The al pastor tasted overly smoky and there was a strange tinge of sweetness underlying the pork flavor, while the carne asada was good but nothing a dozen other 'Bertos clones couldn't pound out. And I'm sorry, but $2.25 is pricey for one bitsy taco. I could almost get two tacos for the same price at my other taco dives.

The elote was also disappointing. I understand that it's ""America's corn"" and their spin on it, but there was zero chile or lime flavor to the corn. It was very tender but totally slathered in mayo and powdery cheese. I added some lime and chile spice with their dipping sauce, but it was still just so-so. 

I'm a taco fiend so I'm giving these guys the benefit of the doubt with three stars (when I really want to give them two). And even though I'm at ASU just about every day of the week, I can't say I see myself coming back."	2	1	1	['alright', 'dont', 'get', 'craze', 'collegi', 'love', 'tini', 'taco', 'shop', 'grant', 'open', 'month', 'sinc', 'third', 'locat', 'doubt', 'menu', 'chang', 'time', 'futur', 'that', 'realli', 'gripe', 'carn', 'asada', 'al', 'pastor', 'pork', 'that', 'theyll', 'serv', 'iter', 'tortilla', 'meat', 'taco', 'bell', 'dream', 'six', 'time', 'fact', 'your', 'stuck', 'either', 'carn', 'asada', 'al', 'pastorneedless', 'say', 'meat', 'mind', 'blow', 'carri', 'limit', 'menu', 'solid', 'noth', 'write', 'home', 'al', 'pastor', 'tast', 'overli', 'smoki', 'strang', 'ting', 'sweet', 'underli', 'pork', 'flavor', 'carn', 'asada', 'good', 'noth', 'dozen', 'berto', 'clone', 'couldnt', 'pound', 'im', 'sorri', 'pricey', 'one', 'bitsi', 'taco', 'could', 'almost', 'get', 'two', 'taco', 'price', 'taco', 'divesth', 'elot', 'also', 'disappoint', 'understand', 'america', 'corn', 'spin', 'zero', 'chile', 'lime', 'flavor', 'corn', 'tender', 'total', 'slather', 'mayo', 'powderi', 'chees', 'ad', 'lime', 'chile', 'spice', 'dip', 'sauc', 'still', 'soso', 'im', 'taco', 'fiend', 'im', 'give', 'guy', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'three', 'star', 'realli', 'want', 'give', 'two', 'even', 'though', 'im', 'asu', 'everi', 'day', 'week', 'cant', 'say', 'see', 'come', 'back']

Essence strikes again. The only way to vanquish these dreams is to lunch here on a regular basis. 

I've been here twice in the past week alone and I think I'm addicted. The atmosphere, product, service, and baked goods have seduced me with their simple elegance. The only gripe I possibly have about this place is the fact that the parking lot is the size of a matchbox, and with Sacks, Cafe Lalibella and Starbucks all occupying the same plaza, finding a place to park during the busy lunch rush is like simultaneously playing Tetris and Frogger.

The atmosphere at Essence is understated in its sophistication. Windows line the majority of the dining room, creating an inviting, open air feeling and the attached patio is charming. Strong earth toned colors and cute little origami flower bouquets grace the tables. Despite the small size of the establishment there are a variety of seating options for single patrons or small groups, and I've never seen people waiting for a table, even during their busiest Friday lunch rush.

A broad array of patrons frequent Essence including hipsters, young professionals, older adults in their power suits, and even a few elders. I haven't seen very many college kids, which may because the food isn't cheap and it's probably ""weirder"" than options on Mill's strip. But I dig the ""weird"" French inspired cuisine. It's decadent and I feel naughty eating it.

Everything I've eaten during lunch has been exceptional. The croque moniseur is far and away the best thing I've tried so far. A grilled sandwich with an egg washed top layer, thin sliced ham, creamy gruyere cheese and jalapenos. It's heavenly crunchy, just as the name suggests. The open face steak sandwich is tender delicious and smothered in buttery sauteed mushrooms with a sprinkle of bleu cheese crumbles as a savory accent. The layers of phyllo dough used in the spanakopita demonstrates some serious painstaking dedication to producing a good product, and the chopped Greek salad was phenomenal. Crispy cucumbers, bell peppers, kalmata olives, feta cheese and tomatoes that tasted like, well, actual tomatoes, for once. Something that you don't often find and an indication that Essence uses amazingly fresh organic product whenever possible. Even the side of potato salad with whole grain mustard was exceptional.

The offerings at their bakery are just as phenomenal as their lunch entrees. The caramel creme macaroon is seriously the most amazing sandwich cookie I've ever tasted, a perfect harmony between savory creme filling and sweet chewy wafers. The strawberry shortcake is amazingly fresh and light, if not a little hard to eat. And their white chocolate raspberry layer cake is the classiest Little Debbie-esque snack cake I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. One day I vow to pick up a box of ""Tasty little treats"" just so I can sample a cupcake and about three cookies without having to choose among all the desserts on display!

I highly recommend this place. Just don't be surprised if you develop an insatiable desire to consume Essence on a daily basis."	9	10	10	['awak', 'wild', 'eye', 'cold', 'sweat', 'vision', 'caramel', 'creme', 'macaroon', 'solicit', 'like', 'high', 'class', 'trick', 'whorehous', 'croqu', 'monsieur', 'swanki', 'pimp', 'demand', 'payment', 'servic', 'essenc', 'strike', 'way', 'vanquish', 'dream', 'lunch', 'regular', 'basi', 'ive', 'twice', 'past', 'week', 'alon', 'think', 'im', 'addict', 'atmospher', 'product', 'servic', 'bake', 'good', 'seduc', 'simpl', 'eleg', 'gripe', 'possibl', 'place', 'fact', 'park', 'lot', 'size', 'matchbox', 'sack', 'cafe', 'lalibella', 'starbuck', 'occupi', 'plaza', 'find', 'place', 'park', 'busi', 'lunch', 'rush', 'like', 'simultan', 'play', 'tetri', 'froggerth', 'atmospher', 'essenc', 'underst', 'sophist', 'window', 'line', 'major', 'dine', 'room', 'creat', 'invit', 'open', 'air', 'feel', 'attach', 'patio', 'charm', 'strong', 'earth', 'tone', 'color', 'cute', 'littl', 'origami', 'flower', 'bouquet', 'grace', 'tabl', 'despit', 'small', 'size', 'establish', 'varieti', 'seat', 'option', 'singl', 'patron', 'small', 'group', 'ive', 'never', 'seen', 'peopl', 'wait', 'tabl', 'even', 'busiest', 'friday', 'lunch', 'rusha', 'broad', 'array', 'patron', 'frequent', 'essenc', 'includ', 'hipster', 'young', 'profession', 'older', 'adult', 'power', 'suit', 'even', 'elder', 'havent', 'seen', 'mani', 'colleg', 'kid', 'may', 'food', 'isnt', 'cheap', 'probabl', 'weirder', 'option', 'mill', 'strip', 'dig', 'weird', 'french', 'inspir', 'cuisin', 'decad', 'feel', 'naughti', 'eat', 'iteveryth', 'ive', 'eaten', 'lunch', 'except', 'croqu', 'moniseur', 'far', 'away', 'best', 'thing', 'ive', 'tri', 'far', 'grill', 'sandwich', 'egg', 'wash', 'top', 'layer', 'thin', 'slice', 'ham', 'creami', 'gruyer', 'chees', 'jalapeno', 'heavenli', 'crunchi', 'name', 'suggest', 'open', 'face', 'steak', 'sandwich', 'tender', 'delici', 'smother', 'butteri', 'saute', 'mushroom', 'sprinkl', 'bleu', 'chees', 'crumbl', 'savori', 'accent', 'layer', 'phyllo', 'dough', 'use', 'spanakopita', 'demonstr', 'seriou', 'painstak', 'dedic', 'produc', 'good', 'product', 'chop', 'greek', 'salad', 'phenomen', 'crispi', 'cucumb', 'bell', 'pepper', 'kalmata', 'oliv', 'feta', 'chees', 'tomato', 'tast', 'like', 'well', 'actual', 'tomato', 'someth', 'dont', 'often', 'find', 'indic', 'essenc', 'use', 'amazingli', 'fresh', 'organ', 'product', 'whenev', 'possibl', 'even', 'side', 'potato', 'salad', 'whole', 'grain', 'mustard', 'exceptionalth', 'offer', 'bakeri', 'phenomen', 'lunch', 'entre', 'caramel', 'creme', 'macaroon', 'serious', 'amaz', 'sandwich', 'cooki', 'ive', 'ever', 'tast', 'perfect', 'harmoni', 'savori', 'creme', 'fill', 'sweet', 'chewi', 'wafer', 'strawberri', 'shortcak', 'amazingli', 'fresh', 'light', 'littl', 'hard', 'eat', 'white', 'chocol', 'raspberri', 'layer', 'cake', 'classiest', 'littl', 'debbieesqu', 'snack', 'cake', 'ive', 'ever', 'pleasur', 'tast', 'one', 'day', 'vow', 'pick', 'box', 'tasti', 'littl', 'treat', 'sampl', 'cupcak', 'three', 'cooki', 'without', 'choos', 'among', 'dessert', 'displayi', 'highli', 'recommend', 'place', 'dont', 'surpris', 'develop', 'insati', 'desir', 'consum', 'essenc', 'daili', 'basi']

The food is mediocre and kind of overpriced for the fare. If you're looking to Caddy it up on the cheap, check out the lunch specials on the weekend or the happy hour deals during the week. If you discount the tchotchke TGI-Chili-Bee's atmosphere, it can be a pretty decent happy hour or football destination if that's your bag.

The appetizer sampler is on par for bar food and a pretty good deal for the price. The sliders are disappointing in terms of size and flavor, but the fries they come with are pretty tasty. Onion rings are grease-heavy and came out cold. Whatevs. The food really isn't the issue I have with this place. It's probably a two stars for the food alone, ""Meh. I've experienced better.""

What pushes this into the dud pile: Crap wait staff that doesn't seem to give a flying rats ass about your table. Straight up grody cocktail combinations that left us feeling like we were about to go into a sugar coma. The seedy vibe at the nightclub coupled with a cover to get in. And the fact that the mechanical bull is like, never on. The night life is really a little slice of the West Side in Tempe. As a reformed G-town resident, I really need to keep away or risk slipping back into my trash person ways.

The wings have always sucked with a weird cloying sweetness that shouldn't be present in a vinegar dominant sauce, and they're always soggy, which is kind of a big bummer. But it's the pizza that's the big star here and I don't know if it's just me but it seems like there's been a slow but noticeable decline in its quality. Less toppings, burnt crust more often than not, cheese that seems to congeal in the five minutes it takes to go from box to mouth. They used to have a lot more hot sandwich and a drink specials too. Chicken parm, cordon bleu, meatball subs, all delicious! Just not offered with as much regularity or in as plentiful a portion as they used to be. 

Plus, and this might be a personal beef, but the drink that came with the two slices special has been scaled back to a much smaller cup. Have the extra couple gulps of soda per transaction really translated to that much of an increase in syrup costs? Is an extra six ounces of drink really hurting business?

One last point and I'll end this sigh-inducing session. The service at Mamma Mia's is really pretty crappy now. Granted it was never the friendliest pizza joint (I seriously don't get the love expressed in all these reviews, as I've never seen it), but I'm just as happy with a terse and professional transaction as I am a chatty one. Now I'm lucky to get so much as acknowledgment upon approaching the counter. Usually just a blank stare from the cashier as they wait for you to speak up, followed by the price of whatever you wanted. No ""Thanks."" No ""It'll be just a minute."" Nada. I'm pretty sure that the scowls on the counter gals are fast becoming fixed.

Don't get me wrong, I'm still going to stop by for a quick couple of slices now and then. I just don't get as excited as I used to. I used to be a super groupie! Mamma Mia!

Hits: 
-Soft shell crab roll. Beautiful presentation, wonderful flavor. The aioli was really nice, and the crab was fried to perfection. 
-Bacon wrapped medjool dates. YES. MORE OF THESE. ALWAYS.
-Wild mushroom tacos. So good you won't miss meat. I echo the concerns of others that they are too small for the price...but I'm willing to pay whatever you demand for more.
-Miso eggplant. Delicate and creamy. Will make a believer even out of the most ardent eggplant hater. Perfect.
-Green magic mojito. This blended drink danced on my taste buds, but if you don't like your drinks herbaceous, go for something else.

Neither here nor there: 
-Guacamole with dried fruit. Decent guac but too much lime, needed more salt and a bit of heat, tomato, or onion flavor. At 11 bucks, it should really come with a couple extra chips instead of making you shell out for more.
-Rollo Chingon. Too much guac on top, but the adobo shrimp sushi was tasty and the roll was stunning to look at. Just take some of that extra avocado topping and smear it on your lotus root chip. 
-Coconut cocktail. Serviceable, but needed something to put it over the top. Couldn't really taste the lemongrass or lime. 
-Valet. You gotta. Ain't no way around it.

Misses: 
-Crispy pork belly roll. So aggressively salty. Could taste hardly anything it was so salty. Should have listened to some of the other reviewers on here and avoided it. 
-Korean beef taco. Salt lick central. So salty you couldn't taste anything else. Really a bummer. Also not traditional Korean beef like you'd get a Korean BBQ, but shredded.
-Head on giant shrimp. Shrimp is singular in this case. And dramatically overcooked. Inconsistent seasoning, with one bite rubbery shrimp and the next almost pure salt rub. The pureed garlic and halved cherry tomatoes were pretty insipid too. Don't waste your 14 bucks on one nasty shrimp.

The aural assault of elevator music redux is an offensive to every fiber of my being.  It penetrates my ear balls and leaves me with a slight tic.  I am not the only person suffering from this affliction.  Consider yourself warned.

Other than blaring tunes to haunt my soul, the Chicago Gyro place is a rock solid choice for a mash up of Mediterranean and Chicago dawgs.  The menu is gimungous and really pretty intimidating.  Luckily I can keep chipping away at it by ordering something different each time, because the food really is pretty inexpensive.  It'll run you about six bucks for a gyro meal deal that comes with fries and a drink, and around eight for the gyro plate that comes with hummus and other deliciousness.  

My only beef, aside from the irrational hatred of Kaaay-Whhhy-Oooooh-Teeee smoooooth jaaaazz, is that the gyros are a little on the dry side and underdressed for my liking.  They are very generous with the meat here and the pitas are top notch, but they only slap, like, a single tomato slice down, and then load that madre up with onions and a tiny squirt of sauce along the bottom.  Now I appreciate a well packed gyro.  By all means, meat it up, but squirt a little of that shit on the top and side of the pita to lubricate my meat hole. (Don't go there.)  Cucumbers would also be a pleasant addition, sirs and madams. (Again, don't go there.)

I turn my head too quick, they take that as a cue to flap their little arms and fly off my head. I bend down to tie my shoe, they hurry to the tip of my nose for a better view. I fall asleep in them, and I'm not sure what kind of antics they get into, but I usually find them in disarray on the ground or tangled in the blankets. Maybe they just wanted to cuddle, but I'm pretty sure they're conspiring to elope to Vegas without me. 

But they're creatures of habit, so it's not too often they pull a fast one on me. (Although every time they do I'm sure they giggle their lenses off as I grope for them like a blind mole-like critter.) They recently hatched a new plan, easily the most devious of the bunch. Instead of working as a team they decided to take their chances solo and rendezvous at a meeting point. That meeting point happened to be my bathroom counter.

I set them down and *plop* what was once one piece was then two. I was so shocked that I conceded a good couple of days to them. Especially since they were willing to go to such extremes to get away from me! While they gloated over their victory I was stuck with my highly unflattering, scratched and cruddy Harry Potter glasses.

After a brief hiatus they agreed to reconcile for the sake of my nose (and my ego). So off to All-American Eyeglass Repair we went! We showed up and were promptly greeted by a young man at the counter. My glasses warmed to him immediately and I could practically hear them purring with contentment. It was an ocular spa day. 

He took my wily little friends into the back (gave 'em a quick massage), popped in a new screw (the happy ending on that massage), then tightened and re-bent (lil chiropractic work) them back into shape. 

Total cost: zero dollars and zero cents. 

My glasses must have sweet talked him while they were in the back because his only requirement was that we come back to him for all our glasses repair needs.

That's cool though because I can't bring myself to eat a ginormous hunk o' muscle very often anyway. I can go years without ending up in a steakhouse and when I do it's generally a meh experience regardless of how orgasmic people tell me the slice of cow is supposed to be. 

Saloon 1889 on the other hand is right up my alley. Hey, we all have our vices. 

The atmosphere is pure Arizona. It's the perfect combination between the slightly nauseating Rawhide's folksy old-Zona and the Rat Pack old school Arizona exemplified by Durant's, with maybe a dash of Monti's La Casa Mediocre tossed in for good measure. 

The bar is a massive antique-looking dark wood relic from another era, with ornate pillars and a huge gilded mirror along one side. The bartenders also look like they could whip you up a classic cocktail, the stuff with bitters, or a girly sugar bomb. They got skills. 

The happy hour is really where's it's at here. Free sliders, chips and salsa. Couple bucks off the bar bites, which are substantial meal replacements. Cheap wine, well, beer, all delivered with a smile."	6	1	3	['ever', 'eaten', 'bar', 'happi', 'hour', 'review', 'old', 'school', 'steak', 'hous', 'fare', 'fixin', 'that', 'cool', 'though', 'cant', 'bring', 'eat', 'ginorm', 'hunk', 'muscl', 'often', 'anyway', 'go', 'year', 'without', 'end', 'steakhous', 'gener', 'meh', 'experi', 'regardless', 'orgasm', 'peopl', 'tell', 'slice', 'cow', 'suppos', 'saloon', 'hand', 'right', 'alley', 'hey', 'vice', 'atmospher', 'pure', 'arizona', 'perfect', 'combin', 'slightli', 'nauseat', 'rawhid', 'folksi', 'oldzona', 'rat', 'pack', 'old', 'school', 'arizona', 'exemplifi', 'durant', 'mayb', 'dash', 'monti', 'la', 'casa', 'mediocr', 'toss', 'good', 'measur', 'bar', 'massiv', 'antiquelook', 'dark', 'wood', 'relic', 'anoth', 'era', 'ornat', 'pillar', 'huge', 'gild', 'mirror', 'along', 'one', 'side', 'bartend', 'also', 'look', 'like', 'could', 'whip', 'classic', 'cocktail', 'stuff', 'bitter', 'girli', 'sugar', 'bomb', 'got', 'skill', 'happi', 'hour', 'realli', 'where', 'free', 'slider', 'chip', 'salsa', 'coupl', 'buck', 'bar', 'bite', 'substanti', 'meal', 'replac', 'cheap', 'wine', 'well', 'beer', 'deliv', 'smile']

I adore this joint as both a bar and a restaurant. It has the best patio in all of Tempe, nay all of Phoenix, no--history. Alright, probably not history. I mean, if there were a bar in the middle of some wicked beautiful natural reserve, I'm sure it would trump Casey's. But I'm not qualifying their worth based on beauty. (Sorry, dearest. I'll make sure to spend freely this weekend to make up for that slight.) The five stars it gets is based on the general relaxing vibe it exudes.

It's far enough off the Mill Avenue strip that the douchebaggery of those bars rarely flows over into Casey's. I've seen that the only gripe most people have with this bar is the occasional frat boy that wanders onto the patio, but even though these specimens in their natural environment are prone to swinging their dicks and strutting with impunity, they act different once they're surrounded by the regular clientele. The regulars could care less that you're the beer pong champion or top sorority sex kitten, can you engage in a meaningful conversation? No? Then kindly take your bulging biceps and stilettos to Scottsdale, where you're sure to be appreciated.

I love the fact that this bar attracts such a broad range of people, all of whom coexist in an atmosphere of mutual respect and happy drunkenness. The elderly come here for the oysters, the hipsters come here to show off their newest tattoo. ASU professors coexist with high school dropouts. Professional bar hoppers chit chat with weekend warriors. The food's pretty wicked as well. 

French onion soup, the Hippie Sandwich, the Tuna Bacon Melt, the Fishwich (without bread it just becomes fish and chips, but way cheaper), the Oysters Rockefeller, the Chipotle Chicken Wings, the Clamstrip basket at 5 bucks a pop...it's greasy and divine. The prices aren't absurd, but are a little on the steep side for bar food, but it's totally worth it. And if you go for happy hour, there are free munchies inside near the dart board.

It's a lovely little pub with a great patio, friendly servers and decent drink prices. Go there often enough and I'm sure its subtle charm will capture your fancy (and your wallet), just as it has countless others.

Dearest Casey Moore, you hold a place in my heart and although my liver denies it, she thinks you're pretty cool too."	5	7	5	['place', 'realli', 'doesnt', 'need', 'anoth', 'review', 'see', 'home', 'away', 'home', 'feel', 'oblig', 'speak', 'peanut', 'galleryi', 'ador', 'joint', 'bar', 'restaur', 'best', 'patio', 'temp', 'nay', 'phoenix', 'nohistori', 'alright', 'probabl', 'histori', 'mean', 'bar', 'middl', 'wick', 'beauti', 'natur', 'reserv', 'im', 'sure', 'would', 'trump', 'casey', 'im', 'qualifi', 'worth', 'base', 'beauti', 'sorri', 'dearest', 'ill', 'make', 'sure', 'spend', 'freeli', 'weekend', 'make', 'slight', 'five', 'star', 'get', 'base', 'gener', 'relax', 'vibe', 'exudesit', 'far', 'enough', 'mill', 'avenu', 'strip', 'douchebaggeri', 'bar', 'rare', 'flow', 'casey', 'ive', 'seen', 'gripe', 'peopl', 'bar', 'occasion', 'frat', 'boy', 'wander', 'onto', 'patio', 'even', 'though', 'specimen', 'natur', 'environ', 'prone', 'swing', 'dick', 'strut', 'impun', 'act', 'differ', 'theyr', 'surround', 'regular', 'clientel', 'regular', 'could', 'care', 'less', 'your', 'beer', 'pong', 'champion', 'top', 'soror', 'sex', 'kitten', 'engag', 'meaning', 'convers', 'kindli', 'take', 'bulg', 'bicep', 'stiletto', 'scottsdal', 'your', 'sure', 'appreciatedi', 'love', 'fact', 'bar', 'attract', 'broad', 'rang', 'peopl', 'coexist', 'atmospher', 'mutual', 'respect', 'happi', 'drunken', 'elderli', 'come', 'oyster', 'hipster', 'come', 'show', 'newest', 'tattoo', 'asu', 'professor', 'coexist', 'high', 'school', 'dropout', 'profession', 'bar', 'hopper', 'chit', 'chat', 'weekend', 'warrior', 'food', 'pretti', 'wick', 'well', 'french', 'onion', 'soup', 'hippi', 'sandwich', 'tuna', 'bacon', 'melt', 'fishwich', 'without', 'bread', 'becom', 'fish', 'chip', 'way', 'cheaper', 'oyster', 'rockefel', 'chipotl', 'chicken', 'wing', 'clamstrip', 'basket', 'buck', 'popit', 'greasi', 'divin', 'price', 'arent', 'absurd', 'littl', 'steep', 'side', 'bar', 'food', 'total', 'worth', 'go', 'happi', 'hour', 'free', 'munchi', 'insid', 'near', 'dart', 'boardit', 'love', 'littl', 'pub', 'great', 'patio', 'friendli', 'server', 'decent', 'drink', 'price', 'go', 'often', 'enough', 'im', 'sure', 'subtl', 'charm', 'captur', 'fanci', 'wallet', 'countless', 'othersdearest', 'casey', 'moor', 'hold', 'place', 'heart', 'although', 'liver', 'deni', 'think', 'your', 'pretti', 'cool']

Sure the vegan spinach and artichoke dip and many types of hummus are amazing, that's what Dr. Hummus and Co does very, very well. They made their name on the farmers market circuit and deserve props for making consistent, solid hummus and dips. It's just too bad they didn't just stick to that.

The soups and salads failed to impress. Either woefully lacking or overly aggressive in flavor, which means there's a quality control issue because no kitchen would send product out if it tasted that off. The GLT was pretty good, mainly because of the awesome spinach and artichoke dip slathered on thick.

To top it all off, you're paying serious farmer market prices. Everything is about 20 percent more expensive that it has any right to be. (Go check out Munch A Lunch on the other side of Tempe for a cheap, humble Mediterranean lunch joint that exceeds where Herb N Flavor fails.) 

Stick to a counter-ordering system for sandwiches. With cheap IKEA decor and only three tables full at lunch time, there's no need for four waitstaff to be wandering around aimless and looking for something, anything, to do. Payroll is way higher than it should be.

Which is why they're charging three bucks for a glass of iced tea. Or eight bucks for a thin slather of spinach and artichoke dip on a platter when I could buy a whole tub of the stuff for the same price. And then I have to tip a luckluster waitstaff on top of everything? I walked out 45 bucks lighter and seriously unimpressed.

Y'all can keep it.

The Downtown Phoenix Public Market is the perfect diversion from this routine! There are a wide variety of stands, especially considering it's such a small market, and there aren't that many tchotchke arts and craft offerings to be had. Just a couple candles and soap stands that are dominated by a lot of fresh and organic edibles. 

Some of the stands offer little samples of their wares, which of course I had to take advantage of. I had a sip of Hansen's orange creme soda, some iced tea, organic hummus with a pita chip and some interesting roasted Mexican seeds that the Aztecs used to cultivate. Those salty, crisp treats made a satisfying pop when I bit 'em, tasting nutty and delicious. Almost bought a bag. Thought better of it when I saw the guy selling baklava.

A small portion of baklava and kataifi was my only purchase, both of which were decadent sweet treats later on after lunch. The layered phyllo dough, the piles of nuts, the honey slathered on thick! It was divine. At 4 bucks for these two tiny squares, it wasn't the best bang for my buck, but the taste totally made up for the size, and when it's that orgasmicly good, size doesn't matter, go ahead and ask anyone. I was also tempted to pick up some pickled asparagus and some jalapeno jelly. Just for kicks.

There was a pretty good live folksy musical act when I was there too, so check out the entertainment if you happen to be in the area. And if you're stuck on a Saturday behind ten other groups vying for the butter soaked goodness of Matt's Big Breakfast, this little market is small enough that you can walk the entire extent of the lot, try all the samples they offer, and make it back to the corner of 1st and McKinley before your party is called."	4	2	6	['even', 'though', 'ive', 'alreadi', 'profess', 'fact', 'dont', 'mind', 'wait', 'awhil', 'order', 'consum', 'delici', 'breakfast', 'food', 'matt', 'certainli', 'dont', 'mind', 'littl', 'divers', 'usual', 'stand', 'around', 'chit', 'chat', 'look', 'custom', 'yummi', 'food', 'wish', 'get', 'water', 'instead', 'sigh', 'downtown', 'phoenix', 'public', 'market', 'perfect', 'divers', 'routin', 'wide', 'varieti', 'stand', 'especi', 'consid', 'small', 'market', 'arent', 'mani', 'tchotchk', 'art', 'craft', 'offer', 'coupl', 'candl', 'soap', 'stand', 'domin', 'lot', 'fresh', 'organ', 'edibl', 'stand', 'offer', 'littl', 'sampl', 'ware', 'cours', 'take', 'advantag', 'sip', 'hansen', 'orang', 'creme', 'soda', 'ice', 'tea', 'organ', 'hummu', 'pita', 'chip', 'interest', 'roast', 'mexican', 'seed', 'aztec', 'use', 'cultiv', 'salti', 'crisp', 'treat', 'made', 'satisfi', 'pop', 'bit', 'em', 'tast', 'nutti', 'delici', 'almost', 'bought', 'bag', 'thought', 'better', 'saw', 'guy', 'sell', 'baklavaa', 'small', 'portion', 'baklava', 'kataifi', 'purchas', 'decad', 'sweet', 'treat', 'later', 'lunch', 'layer', 'phyllo', 'dough', 'pile', 'nut', 'honey', 'slather', 'thick', 'divin', 'buck', 'two', 'tini', 'squar', 'wasnt', 'best', 'bang', 'buck', 'tast', 'total', 'made', 'size', 'orgasmicli', 'good', 'size', 'doesnt', 'matter', 'go', 'ahead', 'ask', 'anyon', 'also', 'tempt', 'pick', 'pickl', 'asparagu', 'jalapeno', 'jelli', 'kicksther', 'pretti', 'good', 'live', 'folksi', 'music', 'act', 'check', 'entertain', 'happen', 'area', 'your', 'stuck', 'saturday', 'behind', 'ten', 'group', 'vy', 'butter', 'soak', 'good', 'matt', 'big', 'breakfast', 'littl', 'market', 'small', 'enough', 'walk', 'entir', 'extent', 'lot', 'tri', 'sampl', 'offer', 'make', 'back', 'corner', 'st', 'mckinley', 'parti', 'call']

One of the reasons is the fact that it's unlikely you'll encounter Frankie Frat puffing out his chest in a courtship ritual to attract the ever preening Suzie Sorority.  This kind of bar act as repellent for those college aged kiddos. 

It might have something to do with the fact that it's really dark inside, illuminated by a couple lights and the glow of massive televisions that consume an entire wall of the bar. Nobody can possibly appreciate the hours it took to gel your hair just right or admire a brand new manicure in this cave-like atmosphere, but me and my low maintenance kind find it just peachy.

The decor is unimaginative and functional, while the bathrooms...well, the toilets work and that's really all I'm looking for.  I remember that I came to the same 'epiphany' as Lauren V. half way through my first visit, ""Ooooh, it's called Prankster's because they flipped all the signs upside down! What wild and crazy jesters! I better keep my eye on them or my potato skins might just be served upside down too!"" Then I laughed heartily in a condescending manner and went back to sipping my way into a solid drunk.

Which is what it basically boils down to for me: cheap drinks and trivia. I'll play some buzztime trivia for hours on a boring weekend afternoon, or until they switch to a sports category, then I just want to throw my controller at the screen. These impulses increase in turn with the number of drinks I consume. 

They've got a pretty big menu as well, which is a nice offering. It's just bar food, not some transcendent culinary delight, but it's decent. Don't get the chili though. Waaaay too earthy with all the cumin they add, to the point where it tastes like you're eating chili beans coated in dirt. I may have made a mean mud pie when I was younger, but those days are now behind me. If you go, get the nachos or the Hot Spot sandwich. Both are stellar.

The menu is ""globally inspired"" but still manages to come off as little more than another New American restaurant riding on its gluten-free, veg 'n' vegan laurels. If you think Pei Wei is ""globally inspired"" good eats, you'll probably dig True Foods. Or if you're looking for a place to take even the pickiest of eaters be they bland food lovers or gluten-lactose intolerant vegetarians.

Tip 1: Beware the nouveau health guru buzz words on the menu. 

Enjoyed the ginger carrot elixir, thought the pomegranate juice was mega overpriced, and why? Because of the omg!antioxidants? Potatoes have freakin' antioxidants but I'm not about to drink a tater slurry.

Tip 2: The food is chain-restaurant quality.

The apps are fairly meager and like everything else on the menu, too expensive for what you get. Hummus comes with a couple measly pita triangles, so make sure to ask for more. The caramelized onion tart is another small but tasty option to share between two people.

The TLT (tempeh, lettuce, and tomato) was a major bummer. The tempeh was cold and hard to bite through, the bread was so dry it tore up the roof of my mouth, and they left off the avocado and mayo. Bison burger was much more moist but practically fell apart upon first bite, so make sure you got a knife and fork at the ready. The kale salad and sweet potatoes are the bomb though. Consider just getting 'em solo to avoid a lackluster entree.

Tip 3. Your food will take freakin' forever to get to you.

The service is obsequious and annoying, but also manages to come off as condescending, impersonal, and rushed? WTH?

When I get that itch to go out and tear up the town, waste away a lazy afternoon, or enjoy a nice dinner, I think of places north, south and west of Tempe. It's like my brain has one of those little electric dog collar things attached to it, and when I start to stray too far east, it gives me a subliminal zap so I erase Mesa from the map in my mind.

So naturally, Stray Cats is usually a place I visit when meeting up with others who have suggested it. 

Thing is, I always end up having a pretty good time when I go there. The drinks are priced reasonably and generally on the strong side, the bartenders are friendly and quick to serve. The music is pretty good, but I've never been here when a DJ's spinning. I used to like the fact that there was an air conditioned smoking room off to the side with plush couches and big televisions. The crowd is always diverse, friendly and easy to engage in slurred conversation.

It just doesn't have any special oomph for me. I'd much rather frequent Hollywood Alley a couple miles south, where there's pool and live music.

There are only two options at this place that are on par with some of the best carne asada or red chicken you'll get from a carniceria. Seeing how the only options are chicken or beef (Or both! Go wild!), it's probably not the best place to bring a leaf eater. They'll be stuck munching on marinated onions, since I'm pretty sure the tortillas and pinto beans have got a lovely amount of lard in them, plus their senses will be assaulted by the delicious smell of succulent, juicy grilled meat. That smell by the way can be detected throughout the strip mall this place is located in, and without a fail gets me salivating whenever I walk by. 

Everything is prepared lightening fast and you can eat in the place or get your food to go. The combos are dirt cheap and delicious, at four bucks for a 1\/4 beef or chicken, and seven bucks for the combination of the two. Each combo comes with two torillas, pinto beans, salsa and maninated onions. Half and whole chickens or piles of beef are also available for extremely reasonable prices. They only take cash though, so run over to the Circle K at Ash and University to the money machine if you find yourself with nothing but plastic. The 2.00 fee to use the ATM will be totally worth it."	5	5	2	['havent', 'go', 'stop', 'read', 'review', 'ignor', 'fact', 'ate', 'hour', 'ago', 'go', 'nosh', 'shit', 'best', 'damn', 'chicken', 'youll', 'find', 'valley', 'two', 'option', 'place', 'par', 'best', 'carn', 'asada', 'red', 'chicken', 'youll', 'get', 'carniceria', 'see', 'option', 'chicken', 'beef', 'go', 'wild', 'probabl', 'best', 'place', 'bring', 'leaf', 'eater', 'theyll', 'stuck', 'munch', 'marin', 'onion', 'sinc', 'im', 'pretti', 'sure', 'tortilla', 'pinto', 'bean', 'got', 'love', 'amount', 'lard', 'plu', 'sens', 'assault', 'delici', 'smell', 'succul', 'juici', 'grill', 'meat', 'smell', 'way', 'detect', 'throughout', 'strip', 'mall', 'place', 'locat', 'without', 'fail', 'get', 'saliv', 'whenev', 'walk', 'everyth', 'prepar', 'lighten', 'fast', 'eat', 'place', 'get', 'food', 'go', 'combo', 'dirt', 'cheap', 'delici', 'four', 'buck', 'beef', 'chicken', 'seven', 'buck', 'combin', 'two', 'combo', 'come', 'two', 'torilla', 'pinto', 'bean', 'salsa', 'manin', 'onion', 'half', 'whole', 'chicken', 'pile', 'beef', 'also', 'avail', 'extrem', 'reason', 'price', 'take', 'cash', 'though', 'run', 'circl', 'k', 'ash', 'univers', 'money', 'machin', 'find', 'noth', 'plastic', 'fee', 'use', 'atm', 'total', 'worth']

It's a restaurant called Cheeburger, Cheeburger!!

The little kid in me squealed with delight. 

Like pasghetti and sammiches, cheeburgers are one of those willfully mispronounced foodstuffs that bring back a little nostalgia. They remind me of those rare days when we'd all pile in my chain smoking babysitter's Caddy and cruise to McD's for cheeburgers, cheapo happy meal toys, and a romp in the pee covered ball pin. 

Urine, second hand smoke, and cheeburgers. I couldn't fathom a better combination at that age.

Then again we didn't have Cheeburger, Cheeburgers when I was a kid. If we did I'd be eating my kid's meal out of a super sweet pink hot rod that looks almost identical to the Barbie mobile, sippin' my hand shaken soda and munchin' on a cheeburger, American, ketchup. I'm in my twenties but I still wanted one of those little card stock car boxes, even if my taste in toppings has become a bit more adventurous.

Just because my tastebuds have matured doesn't make me any more decisive now than I was then. Not a good thing with a place that boasts 50 or so toppings for you burger (or chicken sandwich, or salad-- they're all based on the same ""every order is a special order"" model). I didn't even attempt to figure out what kind of fancy pants shake or soda flavor I wanted (100 flavors, people! 100!!) and just kept it simple with a glass of water in a mason jar. The fries vs. onion rings debate was also too heated, but a basket of crisp and delicious frings came to the rescue. The onion rings were thin and lightly battered, definitely the better of the two options, and the fries were fresh cut and uber greasy, just how I like 'em, even if they were under-salted.

In the end I went with a Classic green chile cheddar burger with the traditional fixins (lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, mustard, ketchup). It was cooked to a perfect medium and the price was right, ringing in at about 5 bucks. I agree that the top bun was way too big in comparison to the bottom, but I solved that by shaving half of it off so I could wrap my mouth around that thick slab of meat, because let's face it people, the bun is just filler. It's all about the meat. It was messy and juices were dripping all over my face, and I must have gone through at least four paper towels, but hot diggity damn, it was a great burger.

The smallest burger possible (the Classic) is about five ounces or so and they increase incrementally until you reach the big mamba jamba 20 ounce 'nother nail in the coffin coronary on a bun. I can't even guess how many pieces of cheese it takes to cover that beast. I did however witness two people finish this outrageous burger while I was enjoying my dainty (by comparison) fare. Both gastric champions had their pictures taken with a gigando stuffed cheeburger (I would have worn it as a hat), and then had their image pasted on the wall of shame...err...fame.

My inner child's parting words are: ""Cheeburger! Cheeburger! Go eat cheeeeeburgerrrrrs!""

My more mature counterpart: ""Ahem, a myriad of combinations are possible between burgers, shakes and sides, variety enough to satisfy even the most discerning of palates and leave everyone...CHEEBURGER!!!""

P.S. Fuck Red Robin in its bony little chicken wing.

And this year I totally neglected to get Mr. Man so much as a card. Dog house! (I thought we weren't celebrating! How was I to know that little sneaker was would bring a smile to my face with a cutesy, cheesy, tchotchky gift and card combo?)

Little did he know that I had an ace up my sleeve. An ace with lots and lots of titacular action. Bombshells! I know that nothing brings a smile to Mr. Man's face quicker than a pair of boobies, so we stopped by on Sunday for some sinful indulgence in an illusionary atmosphere. Being a non-traditionalist doesn't have to be a bad thing.

Sundays are 2 for 1 well drinks and domestic bottles before 7 pm, which is nice when it's $7.75 for a short gin and tonic. There's also no cover, an indication that Sunday nudity lures some guys that are reminiscent of your dad. Expect gentlemen in kahki shorts and button down shirts paying to have a lady rub their bits all over. But at least these gents are better business than the twenty-somethings that just watched the entire time, not a dollar bill in sight. Skeeze. 

It's pretty easy to see which girls are enjoying themselves up there (or at least doing a good job faking it) and who's bored as all get out. We had some very enthusiastic ladies, especially after the shift change at 6pm, and they totally knew how to work the pole in their seven inch heels. Don't come here expecting tig ole fake bitties you usually encounter at Skin or other Scottsdale places. These ladies are au natural and I wouldn't have it any other way. 

What's nicest was this fact that they're willing to sit down and chat with you regardless of whether you're interested in a lap dance or not:
Lovely buxom brunette: ""What are you and your girlfriend celebrating?""
Mr. Man: *baffled, blank stare* ""Sunday?""
LBB: ""Wow! She's a keeper. Hold on to that one!""

Officially out of the dog house.

It's not a brusque, all-business attitude at Bombshells and even though I was the only girl there that wasn't on shift (aside from an awkward couple that came in scowling, stayed for three songs and booked it), there's no awkwardness about it. And since I'm a woman I get the supremely sexy treatment instead of the perfunctory titty shake when I tip.

The icing on our lecherous evening? Mr. Man got a lap dance and the Italian beauty offered to do a couple's one for no extra charge. Now that's class. 

Maybe I'm too harsh on the whole 'tradition' thing.

I have made tabbouleh so delicious that the heavens parted and rained down tears of joy upon its consumption. I will cut a bitch over the last dollop of garlic dip. Don't even get me started on baba ghanoush.

So it's almost a guarantee that I will like anything that draws upon a Mediterranean flavor palate. 

Med Fresh is no exception.

It's technically Turkish, but I don't split hairs when it comes to Mediterranean. The pitas are fresh and flavorful, the tzatziki is kickin' and the gyro meat (beef and chicken) are always moist and delicious. Everything is prepared as you order it and you have a clear view of the goings-on in the sunken kitchen. The staff can be a bit terse at times but they're always professional and quick to disperse a busy lunch rush. 

The platters are priced well for the mound of food you receive, and while I have had some tonsil-scraping dry chicken on occasion, the majority of the time the kabobs and koftas are moist and tender. If you simply can't be pressed to make up your mind, go with the mixed grill and get a bit of a variety. 

The pita sammich special (#16) is the best bang for your buck on the menu. Pita, meat, tomato, lettuce, weird pickles and secret sauce. Served with tzatziki and their killer spicy red sauce. Salad or fries on the side. $6.95.

I was driving to Carlsbad Tavern when the clouds unleashed buckets upon buckets of rain on my car. By the time I got there the rain had subsided to a drizzle and it made for the absolute perfect atmosphere as I walked up the wooden planks into the cave-like atmosphere of Carlsbad Tavern.

But then I looked to the right and saw an empty lagoon with tchotchke plastic turtles and fish upended and scattered atop PVC pipes in the concrete enclosure. I can accept the fact that they wouldn't keep that filled during the summer though. It's a waste of water with all the evaporation, although I'd really like to come here when the waterfall moat thingy is functioning because it looks like it would be great ambiance for a fun dinner!

I got there 15 minutes late and ended up having to wait another 15 minutes for my mom and aunt to arrive (what can I say, we're a punctual family). So I sauntered up to the bar and ordered a margarita on the rocks with salt. Since it was on happy hour it cost me only $3.75 and was a smooth combination of tequila, triple sec and sweet and sour mix. For only four bucks this well concoction was one of the better margaritas in recent memory. Chile pepper lights around the bar with all sorts of bat related memorabilia managed to be campy fun rather than campy trashy and gave me plenty to observe as I was waiting.

Feeling like the traditional Mexican munchies, I ordered the tricolor chips with two salsas. This was an unfortunate choice. The salsa de casa was very coarsely chopped, which made it really hard to dip or spoon onto a chip, and was extremely heavy on tomatoes with few other discernable flavors. The tomatillo salsa tasted okay but was also chopped so coarsely it was like layering strips of tomatillo on chips. The chips weren't too bad, but they were reminiscent of oil they've been using to crisp chimichangas in for the past week. I've worked in food service and I know what old oil tastes like.

But the conversation with my aunt and mom more than made up for the disappointing appetizer, and it cost two whopping bucks so I totally got what I paid for, although it is a little disappointing that they don't come complimentary.

Once we were seated in the main dining room, I was pleased by the atmosphere and decor (stuffed bats hanging from the ceiling! high seat booths with comfy cushions! cool copper light fixtures! rock walls and a huge floor to ceiling rock feature with vegetation!), which managed to maintain a cave-like atmosphere while still being inviting. We placed our order with a very friendly server that was a natural at making small talk and joking around, instead of coming off as peeved that we were taking too long to examine The Daily Guano. I also liked the more open ended, ""Is there anything I can do for you?"" Rather than the usual leading questions like, ""Can I get you something to drink? Do you know what you want to eat?""

I ordered the Enchantment Platter so I could try a little bit of everything, a chicken enchilada, carne adovada burrito, a chile rellano and a sopapilla. When it came out I was pretty disappointed by the presentation. It was smothered in so much sauce and cheese that it was difficult to discern just what the hell I had on my plate and it looked like my burrito had anointed the surrounding items with a liberal splash of greasy red sauce. It most definitely could have done with two plates instead of just one. 

(I'll admit it. It really, really pissed me off. That gut reaction made me want to rate this place around 2 stars instead of 4. I have issues with food presentation. I rearrange every sandwich I order at a restaurant to ensure even distribution of ingredients. I don't care if things are touching and mixing it up, but it better be doing so in an aesthetic manner.)

But once I dug in it turned out to be a delicious meal! The chicken enchilada with tomatillo and green chile was deliciously cheesy with huge chunks of chicken. The carne adovada was tender but relied a bit too heavily on some weird tomato flavor that was thickened with what tasted like cornstarch, solo it was weird, but when the burrito entrails leaked all over the place it added a delicious flavor to the meal. The chile rellano was pure pork and cheese, a dense and delicious concoction nested atop rice and black bean. Rice was generic, black beans were delish.

A.) Dive bars that can't be trusted to give you a clean glass, but can be trusted to offer a complimentary sprinkle of crabs on the toilet seat.
B.) Wholesome off the radar entertainment, cash up front, that may also give you crabs. Sinner.
C.) Cruddy breakfast diners trying to instill an aura of the ""greatest generation."" Why I remember a time back before that newfangled in-ter-net contraption when I had to walk uphill both ways in waist deep snow to... Those demon harpies are trying to steal your identity! Where's my pants?!
D.) All of the above.

Ding! Time's up. Pencils down. 

Original Pancake House, did you answer D? No? You just bubbled in a smiley face on your scantron sheet? Well why not change your answer now, just a little substitute. Oh you charge a minimum of a dollar for any substitute or deviation from your menu. That's straight up retarded. I'm relegating you to the short bus for the remainder of term.

I see that you also have a tiny clause that states you're at liberty to add an 18% gratuity to any order. How very sneaky of you to not define the terms of that. So you're a trouble maker too? I'll be keeping my eye on you.

A strict ""No Cellphones"" policy? Interesting idea, but the place is so obnoxiously loud that I don't see the cause for such a stipulation, and since we only saw our waitress in passing, I can't fathom that it's out of respect for her. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't think you've fully developed that theme. Rework that passage and turn it back in by Monday for full credit.

That brings me to my next point, OPH. It's a great idea to have a wide variety of friends, from brodogs and scottstiudes to old folks and families out for brunch. It's really nice to see you making an effort to make everyone feel included, but your waitstaff, they're crappy, hon. Terse, perfunctory, and cold, like little automatons they whir around the restaurant. Order. Better hope you don't need anything else. Human feelings are not programmed into their model. Eat. Now get out. There are people waiting for your seat. Repeat.

And what gives you the gall to think you can charge $4.25 for three pieces of dinky bacon? OPH, I'm really disappointed in you. Since you don't allow any substitutions and since none of your entrees come with any sides (aside from massive amounts of carb-y, bland pancakes), you're practically forcing people to order certain menu items a la carte. Your food is overpriced as it is. Breakfast for two cost us 35 bucks, and we didn't even get that much food. For shame. I'm assigning you Saturday detention for the remainder of the month. Maybe that'll teach you some respect.

Now let's move on to your coursework. The food that you delivered was actually quite good. I had the Eggs Michael (even though I would have liked to substitute Canadian bacon, I couldn't justify the ridiculous extra charge on an already pricey entree) with four thin potato pancakes. The yolks of the poached eggs created a lovely little dipping sauce, the sausage beneath it jujitsu'd my taste buds to smithereens with its awesomosity, and the English muffin base was crispity and delicious. The accompanying mushroom sauce...what is the term you kids use today...sucked big dangly donkey balls. A flavorless white sauce with canned mushroom floating around looking bored with their lot in life. I can't justify cream sauce unless it's good, and your gravy sucked those donkey balls blue, OPH. The potato pancakes more than made up for the crappy sauce though. Thin little hashbrown patties with sour cream and applesauce! Yum!

Mr. Man ordered the spinach crepes with a side order of homefries and redonkulously overpriced bacon. The homefries were the only stand out aspect of that meal. The spinach filling was soggy, had more tasteless canned mushrooms filler (even came complete with the bland mushroom dipping crap) and I could taste none of the cheese you claimed was there. Quite disappointing, OPH. You did your homework at the last minute on that one, didn't you?

It's clear that you have potential. However since your grade is cumulative, I'm going to have to give you a C. Tut, tut, tut, no complaining. You earned it."	13	16	11	['kind', 'backassward', 'place', 'still', 'cling', 'cash', 'policya', 'dive', 'bar', 'cant', 'trust', 'give', 'clean', 'glass', 'trust', 'offer', 'complimentari', 'sprinkl', 'crab', 'toilet', 'seatb', 'wholesom', 'radar', 'entertain', 'cash', 'front', 'may', 'also', 'give', 'crab', 'sinnerc', 'cruddi', 'breakfast', 'diner', 'tri', 'instil', 'aura', 'greatest', 'gener', 'rememb', 'time', 'back', 'newfangl', 'internet', 'contrapt', 'walk', 'uphil', 'way', 'waist', 'deep', 'snow', 'demon', 'harpi', 'tri', 'steal', 'ident', 'where', 'pantsd', 'aboved', 'time', 'pencil', 'origin', 'pancak', 'hous', 'answer', 'bubbl', 'smiley', 'face', 'scantron', 'sheet', 'well', 'chang', 'answer', 'littl', 'substitut', 'oh', 'charg', 'minimum', 'dollar', 'substitut', 'deviat', 'menu', 'that', 'straight', 'retard', 'im', 'releg', 'short', 'bu', 'remaind', 'termi', 'see', 'also', 'tini', 'claus', 'state', 'your', 'liberti', 'add', 'gratuiti', 'order', 'sneaki', 'defin', 'term', 'your', 'troubl', 'maker', 'ill', 'keep', 'eye', 'youa', 'strict', 'cellphon', 'polici', 'interest', 'idea', 'place', 'obnoxi', 'loud', 'dont', 'see', 'caus', 'stipul', 'sinc', 'saw', 'waitress', 'pass', 'cant', 'fathom', 'respect', 'guess', 'im', 'tri', 'say', 'dont', 'think', 'youv', 'fulli', 'develop', 'theme', 'rework', 'passag', 'turn', 'back', 'monday', 'full', 'creditthat', 'bring', 'next', 'point', 'oph', 'great', 'idea', 'wide', 'varieti', 'friend', 'brodog', 'scottstiud', 'old', 'folk', 'famili', 'brunch', 'realli', 'nice', 'see', 'make', 'effort', 'make', 'everyon', 'feel', 'includ', 'waitstaff', 'theyr', 'crappi', 'hon', 'ters', 'perfunctori', 'cold', 'like', 'littl', 'automaton', 'whir', 'around', 'restaur', 'order', 'better', 'hope', 'dont', 'need', 'anyth', 'els', 'human', 'feel', 'program', 'model', 'eat', 'get', 'peopl', 'wait', 'seat', 'repeatand', 'give', 'gall', 'think', 'charg', 'three', 'piec', 'dinki', 'bacon', 'oph', 'im', 'realli', 'disappoint', 'sinc', 'dont', 'allow', 'substitut', 'sinc', 'none', 'entre', 'come', 'side', 'asid', 'massiv', 'amount', 'carbi', 'bland', 'pancak', 'your', 'practic', 'forc', 'peopl', 'order', 'certain', 'menu', 'item', 'la', 'cart', 'food', 'overpr', 'breakfast', 'two', 'cost', 'us', 'buck', 'didnt', 'even', 'get', 'much', 'food', 'shame', 'im', 'assign', 'saturday', 'detent', 'remaind', 'month', 'mayb', 'thatll', 'teach', 'respectnow', 'let', 'move', 'coursework', 'food', 'deliv', 'actual', 'quit', 'good', 'egg', 'michael', 'even', 'though', 'would', 'like', 'substitut', 'canadian', 'bacon', 'couldnt', 'justifi', 'ridicul', 'extra', 'charg', 'alreadi', 'pricey', 'entre', 'four', 'thin', 'potato', 'pancak', 'yolk', 'poach', 'egg', 'creat', 'love', 'littl', 'dip', 'sauc', 'sausag', 'beneath', 'jujitsud', 'tast', 'bud', 'smithereen', 'awesomos', 'english', 'muffin', 'base', 'crispiti', 'delici', 'accompani', 'mushroom', 'saucewhat', 'term', 'kid', 'use', 'todaysuck', 'big', 'dangli', 'donkey', 'ball', 'flavorless', 'white', 'sauc', 'can', 'mushroom', 'float', 'around', 'look', 'bore', 'lot', 'life', 'cant', 'justifi', 'cream', 'sauc', 'unless', 'good', 'gravi', 'suck', 'donkey', 'ball', 'blue', 'oph', 'potato', 'pancak', 'made', 'crappi', 'sauc', 'though', 'thin', 'littl', 'hashbrown', 'patti', 'sour', 'cream', 'applesauc', 'yummr', 'man', 'order', 'spinach', 'crepe', 'side', 'order', 'homefri', 'redonkul', 'overpr', 'bacon', 'homefri', 'stand', 'aspect', 'meal', 'spinach', 'fill', 'soggi', 'tasteless', 'can', 'mushroom', 'filler', 'even', 'came', 'complet', 'bland', 'mushroom', 'dip', 'crap', 'could', 'tast', 'none', 'chees', 'claim', 'quit', 'disappoint', 'oph', 'homework', 'last', 'minut', 'one', 'didnt', 'youit', 'clear', 'potenti', 'howev', 'sinc', 'grade', 'cumul', 'im', 'go', 'give', 'c', 'tut', 'tut', 'tut', 'complain', 'earn']

It's sweet and vinegary and weird and ruins perfectly good smoked meat. But the last two times I've been out for this kind of food, I have been pleasantly surprised. Maybe as I age my appreciation for tangy tomato sugar paste matures. I'm a classy broad like that. Or maybe I just need to frequent places that know how to serve up barbeque right, and that's exactly what Urban Campfire does.

They couldn't have chosen a better location for the restaurant, within walking distance of the University, and I'm wicked pleased that nasty fucking Greasy Tony's finally crawled into its dingy little hole and died. I don't even want to know how much cleaning they had to undertake in order to reincarnate the tiny little shithole as a sparkling and inviting little diner. 

After swinging by this little place on a Monday night to see it closed, I was bummed and a little skeptical that it would be open at 8:00 on a Sunday evening. The neon sign was beckoning me to enter, but the chairs had already been stacked against the front windows and it looked like they were doing the ohgodit'sslowpleasecanwegohome prolonged breakdown, so Mr. Man went and peeked his head in to inquire if they were still able to do a take out order. Oh yeah, it was smoked meat time. 

The menu had all sorts of delicious sounding sandwiches and the barbeque staples, and most of it was heavy on the meat, so keep the veg heads away from this butcher shop or they'll be forced to nibble on the sides. The server couldn't have been more personal and engaging as we chatted about the menu offerings and details about the new place. After listening to her recommendations I ended up going with the pulled pork sandwich with beans for $7.95, while Mr. Man got the half rack of ribs with beans and fries. 

She was chatting up a storm with us about how good the food was and even gave us a sample of their special of the day, Sloppy Joes, which was bangin'! I had no idea sloppy joes could possibly shake their Manwich stigma, but the meat was tender and spiced just right and I can't even explain it. It was off the hook good and it was a fucking spoonful of sloppy joes. I still can't wrap my head around it. 

Once our orders were up we trotted home and dug into massive amounts of mouthwatering good barbeque. The sauce wasn't overly vinegary or tomatoey or sweet, and all the flavors complemented one another and lovingly embraced my porky goodness. Three huge sliders were included in my order, the buns were soft as marshmallow fluff and the beans, oh, the beans! Crispy little strips of bacon high fived my beanie little friends to double team the flavor factor. The ribs were HUGE and were definitely the stand out entree ordered. They were smoked on the premises, nicely charred and melt off the bone tender. The dogs agree with me, even though they just got the bones. Beware the french fries. They're limp since they're freshly cut and fried. But they were smothered in fresh garlic, so I found a way to overlook that little deterrent. 

They also have a ton of drink specials, from the tried and true bottle of domestic brew to funky flavored sangrias. And although I didn't try it, their dessert is a haystack cookie made of pretzel sticks, mini marshmallows, peanut butter and butterscotch sauce and they sound like something I would have made when I was too young to use the stove so I was dependent on the microwave for making chex mix and shit on a shingle. (I had a Jell-o cook book as a kiddo and tried just about every recipe in there, including the nasty mixed vegetables suspended in unflavored gelatin and beef stock. Weird.) They're also in the process of creating a patio out front where you can enjoy a picnic like atmosphere with the food to complement it. 

So I guess I have to revise my opening statement. I'm a recovering barbeque-phobe, and this cheap as sin, make me groan with pleasure barbeque joint will definitely be worked into the regular rotation.

Since I haven't eaten there more than once, I'm giving it four stars, but if it continues to be this awesome, it'll be a five star joint for me!"	5	6	4	['confess', 'time', 'dont', 'realli', 'like', 'barbequ', 'sweet', 'vinegari', 'weird', 'ruin', 'perfectli', 'good', 'smoke', 'meat', 'last', 'two', 'time', 'ive', 'kind', 'food', 'pleasantli', 'surpris', 'mayb', 'age', 'appreci', 'tangi', 'tomato', 'sugar', 'past', 'matur', 'im', 'classi', 'broad', 'like', 'mayb', 'need', 'frequent', 'place', 'know', 'serv', 'barbequ', 'right', 'that', 'exactli', 'urban', 'campfir', 'doesthey', 'couldnt', 'chosen', 'better', 'locat', 'restaur', 'within', 'walk', 'distanc', 'univers', 'im', 'wick', 'pleas', 'nasti', 'fuck', 'greasi', 'toni', 'final', 'crawl', 'dingi', 'littl', 'hole', 'die', 'dont', 'even', 'want', 'know', 'much', 'clean', 'undertak', 'order', 'reincarn', 'tini', 'littl', 'shithol', 'sparkl', 'invit', 'littl', 'diner', 'swing', 'littl', 'place', 'monday', 'night', 'see', 'close', 'bum', 'littl', 'skeptic', 'would', 'open', 'sunday', 'even', 'neon', 'sign', 'beckon', 'enter', 'chair', 'alreadi', 'stack', 'front', 'window', 'look', 'like', 'ohgoditsslowpleasecanwegohom', 'prolong', 'breakdown', 'mr', 'man', 'went', 'peek', 'head', 'inquir', 'still', 'abl', 'take', 'order', 'oh', 'yeah', 'smoke', 'meat', 'time', 'menu', 'sort', 'delici', 'sound', 'sandwich', 'barbequ', 'stapl', 'heavi', 'meat', 'keep', 'veg', 'head', 'away', 'butcher', 'shop', 'theyll', 'forc', 'nibbl', 'side', 'server', 'couldnt', 'person', 'engag', 'chat', 'menu', 'offer', 'detail', 'new', 'place', 'listen', 'recommend', 'end', 'go', 'pull', 'pork', 'sandwich', 'bean', 'mr', 'man', 'got', 'half', 'rack', 'rib', 'bean', 'fri', 'chat', 'storm', 'us', 'good', 'food', 'even', 'gave', 'us', 'sampl', 'special', 'day', 'sloppi', 'joe', 'bangin', 'idea', 'sloppi', 'joe', 'could', 'possibl', 'shake', 'manwich', 'stigma', 'meat', 'tender', 'spice', 'right', 'cant', 'even', 'explain', 'hook', 'good', 'fuck', 'spoon', 'sloppi', 'joe', 'still', 'cant', 'wrap', 'head', 'around', 'order', 'trot', 'home', 'dug', 'massiv', 'amount', 'mouthwat', 'good', 'barbequ', 'sauc', 'wasnt', 'overli', 'vinegari', 'tomatoey', 'sweet', 'flavor', 'complement', 'one', 'anoth', 'lovingli', 'embrac', 'porki', 'good', 'three', 'huge', 'slider', 'includ', 'order', 'bun', 'soft', 'marshmallow', 'fluff', 'bean', 'oh', 'bean', 'crispi', 'littl', 'strip', 'bacon', 'high', 'five', 'beani', 'littl', 'friend', 'doubl', 'team', 'flavor', 'factor', 'rib', 'huge', 'definit', 'stand', 'entre', 'order', 'smoke', 'premis', 'nice', 'char', 'melt', 'bone', 'tender', 'dog', 'agre', 'even', 'though', 'got', 'bone', 'bewar', 'french', 'fri', 'theyr', 'limp', 'sinc', 'theyr', 'freshli', 'cut', 'fri', 'smother', 'fresh', 'garlic', 'found', 'way', 'overlook', 'littl', 'deterr', 'also', 'ton', 'drink', 'special', 'tri', 'true', 'bottl', 'domest', 'brew', 'funki', 'flavor', 'sangria', 'although', 'didnt', 'tri', 'dessert', 'haystack', 'cooki', 'made', 'pretzel', 'stick', 'mini', 'marshmallow', 'peanut', 'butter', 'butterscotch', 'sauc', 'sound', 'like', 'someth', 'would', 'made', 'young', 'use', 'stove', 'depend', 'microwav', 'make', 'chex', 'mix', 'shit', 'shingl', 'jello', 'cook', 'book', 'kiddo', 'tri', 'everi', 'recip', 'includ', 'nasti', 'mix', 'veget', 'suspend', 'unflavor', 'gelatin', 'beef', 'stock', 'weird', 'theyr', 'also', 'process', 'creat', 'patio', 'front', 'enjoy', 'picnic', 'like', 'atmospher', 'food', 'complement', 'guess', 'revis', 'open', 'statement', 'im', 'recov', 'barbequephob', 'cheap', 'sin', 'make', 'groan', 'pleasur', 'barbequ', 'joint', 'definit', 'work', 'regular', 'rotationsinc', 'havent', 'eaten', 'im', 'give', 'four', 'star', 'continu', 'awesom', 'itll', 'five', 'star', 'joint']

It's uncomfortable and a little depressing, but if you repeat the ritual often enough it becomes a tolerable way to spend the evening. You just have to bring your own friends and take advantage of the cheap beer, because it's better with a buzz.

Don't believe me? Let's think back to the dusty basement\/garage\/rec room that you and all your buddies used to hang out in during high school. If you had friends with money there were ping pong tables, air hockey, pool tables or video games. Of if your friends were more like mine, a TV with rabbit ears. (Doc & Eddy's is the kid with all the cool shit you never had, even though you volunteered to use the pool table as a bed in between games to save space.)

Invariably the furniture had been cast off by surrounding rooms, relegating it to its current purgatory where collapsed cushions, cracked upholstery and wobbly tables may have mingled with bar stools and high tables, the occasional uncomfortable folding chair thrown in for the asshole that shows up unexpectedly and doesn't have anywhere to sit. Incandescent lights shone down on your little domestic beer swilling group and the walls were barren of adornment because you were too cheap to go buy some crap posters to put up over the yellowing wall paper, and mom didn't like nail holes in her dry wall. (Kinda crappy 70s seating. Nicely played, Doc.)

But you're pretty much the big shit because your parents are out of town, so you invite all your friends over and hope that some cool older kids come too. But that doesn't happen. (Cuz Eddy's at the bar acting like a skeeze.)

The creepy old dude that still likes hanging out with high school kids is staring down your cleavage chuckling with his douchewad buddies and declaring with aplomb, ""Nice boobs!"" The jocks are all playing beer pong or clustered around a TV yelling defensive plays at the screen, convinced that the more animated they get the more cred they'll earn with their meat head buddies. A gaggle of girls will descend upon the party later in the evening since they spent an hour getting their hair just right. They'll be wearing makeup that they applied more like spackle and dress in skin tight clothing that advertises every curve, muffin top and camel toe. 

Someone will puke in the bathroom. Some other folks will get all surly and square off or shoot each other bitch eyes for the rest of the night. And you'll end up with something broken, adding to the overall depressing air of the dilapidated rec room.

Exchange the morning after whiskey dents and zombie flavored scratch 'n sniff composure for a posh dinner out on the town.

Now I'm gonna share a secret with y'all. I'm no gourmand. I like a fancy pants meal as much as the next, but I'm in the cheap mo fo demographic, so I don't know dick about fine dining in the Phoenix area. I rely on you Yelpers to guide me down the path of good taste when it comes to nice shit and stuff.

Cha, cha, cha.

MEDIZONA.

It even sounds fancy, and I'm convinced it should be said with jazz fingers and maybe some light orchestral flare.

An upscale, Mediterranean-Southwestern fusion restaurant?

Intriguing.

Rabbit and fig baklava atop a pomegranate balsamic reduction, topped with a quail egg and surrounded by crispity parsnip curls?

Wicked fricken good.

It puts fig newtons everywhere to shame. Layers of airy, buttery phyllo filled with tender shredded fig and rabbit would have been much too sweet solo, but the addition of a tart reduction grabbed that figgy sweetness and tangoed round my palate! Although I'm convinced that the quail egg was just intended to be a cute little hat for the baklava. Whatevs. At least now I can claim that psh, yeah I've had quail egg before, no biggie.

Wild caught halibut with chorizo potato cake, haricot verts and carrots with orange caper cream sauce?

Melt in my mouth delicious.

Try to sneak a nibble of chorizo potato cake from my plate and I will fork you. Hard. You might pull back something a little stumpy. That was the most delectable little nibblet on the plate. The fish was super flaky and buttery, although the sauce was forgettable. And I think it's pretentious and hoity toity to call green beans ""haricot verts."" Merde!

Roast loin of lamb, moussaka tart, mashed taters, celery root, mint oil, and roasted red pepper sauce?

Eh. 

The lamb was ordered medium rare and prepared to perfection. Mint oil should be mandatory garnish for all baby lambs. Make em prance around the field wearing mint garlands until they're led to slaughter, where said garland will be compressed into the requisite drizzle of mint oil. Or something like that. Everything else on the plate was served cold though. Blech.

The service was impeccable, the patrons gripe worthy. Our waiter was well informed and personable, although he disappeared half way through the meal, was replaced and we never saw him again, which was kinda weird. 

The customers he was serving were pretty inconsiderate. There was a huge party of people with kids rip roaring around the restaurant off in the side room. The waiter apologized on their behalf, stating that it was an abnormal night and that kids didn't normally frequent the place, and at least they left soon after that. I don't go out to listen to the rip roar of impatient ankle biters. Instant plus two for the atmosphere as soon as they left.

But then a large group of older patrons came in and bitched about how they couldn't read the menus because it was too dark, so they turned up the lights, bent the atmosphere over the side of a chair and fucked it hard.

So I think I'm going to be a downer on the super streak Medizona's having and only give it a four. It's good but I don't think I'd ever go back. Too many other fancy schmancy restaurants waiting in the wings for an opportunity to knock my socks off.

I have one reason that is the indisputable, unassailable, golden rationale for why you should visit the Roosevelt: SHARK BEER! So important it deserves both capitalization and idolization.

Distilled from the finest aquatic varieties and banned in all fifty states, its pale gold, opaque frothiness will lull you into a happy state of drunkenness and sociability. The Great White Northern is by far the finest beer to ever pass these lips. I've had the wine on occasion, but compared to the deliciosity that is Shark Beer, my only recollection is that it doesn't suck.

I regrettably haven't had the full Roosevelt experience, as I've never spent any moolah on the food there. Well, Mr. Man did order the four dollar peanuts once and I tried them. Yes. Four dollars. For a pile of peanuts. Weird thing is he thought they were worth every penny. Granted, they were huge, warm and tasty, but they're fucking four dollar peanuts! Aside from that, I've heard from a fair number of people that the food is delectable and worth the price, but I've never been in the munching mood here. 

Happy hour is undoubtedly the best time to visit this little bastion of class and comfort in downtown Phoenix, and every time I have been here at this hour the bar has been packed with well dressed and business casual folks. Evenings are a bit more intimate with fewer people, but you're pretty much guaranteed a seat somewhere, or if you come with a group of friends (that's my shout out to the lovely Yelpers I met here recently!) there is ample space for your group to socialize.

When you go, check out the funky little door in the central room above the bathroom corridor, and then tell me just where you think it leads or what they're hiding up there. Is it a portal to another dimension? Do they keep some red headed stepchild up there? Or is this where people who try to skip out on their tabs are detained? The mystery brings my overactive imagination great joy. I also dig the naked lady checking out a passing train picture in the restroom, which is like, big enough to entertain company in.

My one gripe is that they keep it cold as a meat locker in there, and my little toesies need dethawing in the Arizona heat after I exit the building. And this pithy reason's got nothing on the Roosevelt.

Edible flowers for crystallizing, espresso powder for my meat rubs, fancy pants mushrooms, high quality chocolate, duck fat, mangosteens outside of an Asian grocer, the works.

We called ahead of time to make an appointment and clarify that the voucher was good for one free visit and were given the all clear. So thermometers were inserted in very awkward places and our little pup was weighed, measured, and found to be totally awesome. End of vet visit we're presented with a bill for 40 some odd bucks.

After some pretty heavy complaining that, ""WTF, mate? That's not what you said on the phone,"" they waived the initial visitation fee and let us go on our merry way. I've cross checked the prices here with other vets to get the little booger vaccinated and sure enough, they charged for the vet visit in addition to the vaccination fees. 

Go to Blue Cross Animal Clinic down the street and they'll charge you the flat fee for the vaccine, no office visit or nothin'. Sure beats the crappy clinic at Petsmart too, where they charge the same straight fee for the vaccines and waive the vet visit.

Go order a Dagwood from Gandolfo's deli. It's roast beef, turkey, ham, pastrami, swiss, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, mayo, spicy mustard, salt and pepper, as close to nirvana as I'm ever getting. (In case you couldn't tell by the ingredients, I was a little indecisive about what kind of sandwich I wanted, so I just took the works.)

During lunch it can get a little hairy in Gandolfo's deli, and I'm not talking about the number of people there (which is many) but the ratio of males to females (which is very high, me being the only customer lacking a y chromosome). There is a reason why this is so. These sandwiches are monstrous meat and cheese concoctions slathered in sauce and served big. I could easily make a phallic reference about all these men consuming massive hoagies, but I'm going to take the high road this review.

I was considering the hard salami smothered in sauce, but I didn't know if it would be filling enough...

Okay. So the low road suits me better. 

I opted for the $2.49 meal deal to complement my Dagwood, which left me with a gigantic sandwich, a quarter pound of potato salad, and a regular iced tea with plenty left over for dinner that night. It was close to ten bucks after tax, which is a little bit on the pricey side, but at least I made two meals of it. 

The potato salad was decent but lacked salt, like they didn't bother boiling the potatoes with this necessary ingredient. I love me some salt. Get me a lick and I'll take a cheese grater to it to season my meals. Or make me a salt flavored ring pop for those mid day cravings. My blood pressure will curse you, but I'll be singing your praises. After adding this magic ingredient Gandolfo's potato salad got pretty good, and they get extra credit for using red potatoes, leaving the skin on, and preparing it with vinaigrette and mayo instead of mustard.

(Go look at the pictures.) ""It washes out with water,"" they said. It rubs out with 20 minutes of sedentary dog loafing. 

Base cut $60. 
Mohawk down back $15. 
Sweaty armpit stain color $25. 

Also, the pigment is oil based and not a dry powder like chalk, so it goes on wet, dries oily, and leaves behind a yellowish residue. Really awful look all around. 

Would have much preferred some guidance from the staff more along the lines of, ""You know you're paying for a dollar per minute of color, right? And that the color leaves an oily residue that will completely negate taking your dog in to be professionally groomed? And that it goes on wet then dries so any texture in your dog's fur will seize up? And that the color doesn't fade, but instead completely disappears leaving behind a yellowish stain?""

Yeah, neither do I, but I've been told from the horse's mouth (sorry to call you a horse, Mr. Man) that it used to be a hip and happening place with plenty of small, custom shops and dives instead of the now ubiquitous mega-corporate whorebaggery. Luckily, you have only to travel a little bit further west on University to steep yourself in that old school neighborhood feel. 

Thai Basil gets big stars for being one of these homey neighborhood joints. Along with El Pollo, Tops, Tempe Bicycle, HTC, Otto's, Headquarters, Buffalo, etc., this locally owned restaurant has consistently provided inviting ambiance, wonderful service and delicious food for pennies compared to anything on Mill.

I just finished my leftover red curry chicken just before I wrote this, and it was every bit as savory and rich as it was last night (just make sure to put the leftover sticky rice in a plastic bag or it'll get crusty). The fragrance and flavor of all their curries (red, green, yellow, and peanut) is if not unmatched, pretty damn close to the best offered at any Thai place I've dined. Thick, al dente, crinkle cut carrots, bamboo shoots, green beans, broccoli, zucchini, red and green peppers with tender choice of meat afloat in savory coconut milk that suspends the perfect amount of earthy spice and hot chili to ensure that the meal dances on your taste buds.

My favorite dishes aside, just about everything on the menu at Thai Basil has proved to be exemplary. The Thai Basil is their signature dish and certainly doesn't skimp on its namesake fresh basil and thick flavorful sauce. The Pad Thai is sure as hell better than what's offered at Bamboo Club, with ample crushed peanuts and noodles that don't turn into a puddle of goo once the dish cools. The Garlic Pork has a lighter sauce that still manages all the fragrance and flavor of its more syrupy counterparts. The papaya salad is crisp, citric, sweet and spicy, an excellent accompaniment to a rich meal. Or try the crispy spring rolls that manage to be filling despite their humble size. The chicken satay with peanut sauce is also a very good choice for picky eaters (or kiddos), although they'll truly miss out on the more complex flavors of this amazing food. 

Thai Basil is a fairly small restaurant with dark wood tables that are all very closely spaced to ensure the maximum number of people can be seated. There is booth seating along the back and stretching the length of one side, while high tables and chairs are located in the windowed area facing Farmer. The decorations are sparse but complement the overall Asian feel, with bamboo accessories, knick knacks and family pictures decorating the walls. The richly colored, metallic embroidered skirt\/pants worn by the waitresses are also for sale if you're looking for something special to spice up your wardrobe.

Despite its small size, I've never experienced the long wait times that others have when I come here. The servers have always been very attentive and quick to refill a glass or take my order, and are honest with their opinion when asked what they enjoy on the menu. I don't generally go here on busy nights though, and the hours I attend are either early or late evening, so maybe I avoid the hectic rush, because the kitchen is pretty small. At least you know you're getting fresh Thai from the folks who know it best as a result. If you don't have a lot of time to wait and just want a quick dinner, it's also possible to phone in your order or walk in, order, visit the shops around the restaurant and return in ten minutes to a piping hot order.

Try out the lunch specials! They're a great deal and they get you in and out within the hour. Although this is the one time of the day I've been when it's a bit on the slow side, since the entire restaurant is always packed. But the crowd is oddly well staggered since I've never seen anyone waiting for a table. For about eight bucks you get a small salad with tangy sweet vinaigrette, a spring roll with sweet and sour sauce, and your choice of dish with a ball of rice on the side. It's usually enough so I have one extra lunch leftover, compared to the two lunches I usually have with the regular dinner dishes. 

One thing I've noticed over time is that their ""hot"" really isn't that hot, so if you like it spicy, make sure to specify. 

Thai Basil is a comfortable neighborhood restaurant that attracts the type of customers Mill Avenue only wishes it could, loyal ones. As Mill whores itself out to the highest corporate bidder, I envision the property owners diving through coins like Scrooge McDuck and doing their best impression of Mr. Burns'. But the obscene retail rent checks signed reflects the boost in product price and the blandness of corporate hegemony. It's a relief for this starving-but-no-longer-student to support a local eatery by driving just a little west of that circus."	9	5	8	['anyon', 'rememb', 'mill', 'avenu', 'use', 'fun', 'place', 'hang', 'yeah', 'neither', 'ive', 'told', 'hors', 'mouth', 'sorri', 'call', 'hors', 'mr', 'man', 'use', 'hip', 'happen', 'place', 'plenti', 'small', 'custom', 'shop', 'dive', 'instead', 'ubiquit', 'megacorpor', 'whorebaggeri', 'luckili', 'travel', 'littl', 'bit', 'west', 'univers', 'steep', 'old', 'school', 'neighborhood', 'feel', 'thai', 'basil', 'get', 'big', 'star', 'one', 'homey', 'neighborhood', 'joint', 'along', 'el', 'pollo', 'top', 'temp', 'bicycl', 'htc', 'otto', 'headquart', 'buffalo', 'etc', 'local', 'own', 'restaur', 'consist', 'provid', 'invit', 'ambianc', 'wonder', 'servic', 'delici', 'food', 'penni', 'compar', 'anyth', 'milli', 'finish', 'leftov', 'red', 'curri', 'chicken', 'wrote', 'everi', 'bit', 'savori', 'rich', 'last', 'night', 'make', 'sure', 'put', 'leftov', 'sticki', 'rice', 'plastic', 'bag', 'itll', 'get', 'crusti', 'fragranc', 'flavor', 'curri', 'red', 'green', 'yellow', 'peanut', 'unmatch', 'pretti', 'damn', 'close', 'best', 'offer', 'thai', 'place', 'ive', 'dine', 'thick', 'al', 'dent', 'crinkl', 'cut', 'carrot', 'bamboo', 'shoot', 'green', 'bean', 'broccoli', 'zucchini', 'red', 'green', 'pepper', 'tender', 'choic', 'meat', 'afloat', 'savori', 'coconut', 'milk', 'suspend', 'perfect', 'amount', 'earthi', 'spice', 'hot', 'chili', 'ensur', 'meal', 'danc', 'tast', 'budsmi', 'favorit', 'dish', 'asid', 'everyth', 'menu', 'thai', 'basil', 'prove', 'exemplari', 'thai', 'basil', 'signatur', 'dish', 'certainli', 'doesnt', 'skimp', 'namesak', 'fresh', 'basil', 'thick', 'flavor', 'sauc', 'pad', 'thai', 'sure', 'hell', 'better', 'what', 'offer', 'bamboo', 'club', 'ampl', 'crush', 'peanut', 'noodl', 'dont', 'turn', 'puddl', 'goo', 'dish', 'cool', 'garlic', 'pork', 'lighter', 'sauc', 'still', 'manag', 'fragranc', 'flavor', 'syrupi', 'counterpart', 'papaya', 'salad', 'crisp', 'citric', 'sweet', 'spici', 'excel', 'accompani', 'rich', 'meal', 'tri', 'crispi', 'spring', 'roll', 'manag', 'fill', 'despit', 'humbl', 'size', 'chicken', 'satay', 'peanut', 'sauc', 'also', 'good', 'choic', 'picki', 'eater', 'kiddo', 'although', 'theyll', 'truli', 'miss', 'complex', 'flavor', 'amaz', 'food', 'thai', 'basil', 'fairli', 'small', 'restaur', 'dark', 'wood', 'tabl', 'close', 'space', 'ensur', 'maximum', 'number', 'peopl', 'seat', 'booth', 'seat', 'along', 'back', 'stretch', 'length', 'one', 'side', 'high', 'tabl', 'chair', 'locat', 'window', 'area', 'face', 'farmer', 'decor', 'spars', 'complement', 'overal', 'asian', 'feel', 'bamboo', 'accessori', 'knick', 'knack', 'famili', 'pictur', 'decor', 'wall', 'richli', 'color', 'metal', 'embroid', 'skirtpant', 'worn', 'waitress', 'also', 'sale', 'your', 'look', 'someth', 'special', 'spice', 'wardrobedespit', 'small', 'size', 'ive', 'never', 'experienc', 'long', 'wait', 'time', 'other', 'come', 'server', 'alway', 'attent', 'quick', 'refil', 'glass', 'take', 'order', 'honest', 'opinion', 'ask', 'enjoy', 'menu', 'dont', 'gener', 'go', 'busi', 'night', 'though', 'hour', 'attend', 'either', 'earli', 'late', 'even', 'mayb', 'avoid', 'hectic', 'rush', 'kitchen', 'pretti', 'small', 'least', 'know', 'your', 'get', 'fresh', 'thai', 'folk', 'know', 'best', 'result', 'dont', 'lot', 'time', 'wait', 'want', 'quick', 'dinner', 'also', 'possibl', 'phone', 'order', 'walk', 'order', 'visit', 'shop', 'around', 'restaur', 'return', 'ten', 'minut', 'pipe', 'hot', 'ordertri', 'lunch', 'special', 'theyr', 'great', 'deal', 'get', 'within', 'hour', 'although', 'one', 'time', 'day', 'ive', 'bit', 'slow', 'side', 'sinc', 'entir', 'restaur', 'alway', 'pack', 'crowd', 'oddli', 'well', 'stagger', 'sinc', 'ive', 'never', 'seen', 'anyon', 'wait', 'tabl', 'eight', 'buck', 'get', 'small', 'salad', 'tangi', 'sweet', 'vinaigrett', 'spring', 'roll', 'sweet', 'sour', 'sauc', 'choic', 'dish', 'ball', 'rice', 'side', 'usual', 'enough', 'one', 'extra', 'lunch', 'leftov', 'compar', 'two', 'lunch', 'usual', 'regular', 'dinner', 'dish', 'one', 'thing', 'ive', 'notic', 'time', 'hot', 'realli', 'isnt', 'hot', 'like', 'spici', 'make', 'sure', 'specifi', 'thai', 'basil', 'comfort', 'neighborhood', 'restaur', 'attract', 'type', 'custom', 'mill', 'avenu', 'wish', 'could', 'loyal', 'one', 'mill', 'whore', 'highest', 'corpor', 'bidder', 'envis', 'properti', 'owner', 'dive', 'coin', 'like', 'scroog', 'mcduck', 'best', 'impress', 'mr', 'burn', 'obscen', 'retail', 'rent', 'check', 'sign', 'reflect', 'boost', 'product', 'price', 'bland', 'corpor', 'hegemoni', 'relief', 'starvingbutnolongerstud', 'support', 'local', 'eateri', 'drive', 'littl', 'west', 'circu']

Challenge: If you can find a better happy hour than the three dollar bonanza at Cafe Zuzu, I will eat one of the wretched pickled eggs from Palo Verde Lounge, the gray-green eggs that time forgot.

I'll start with the tapas-style appetizers because they really blew me away. Two fall-of-the-bone tender braised pork shanks that will melt in your mouth and fill your belly? Three bucks. A surprisingly ample mini prime rib dip with (unassuming) horseradish mayo and au jus? Three bucks. Two buttery, rich grilled brie and thin sliced green apple sandwiches with fig jam reduction? Three bucks. I'm salivating right now. 

The other two options included the border chili, which had fresh chunks of meat but was a bit bland compared to the rest of the apps, and the bruschetta that was utterly forgettable. Standard tomatoes, olives and capers, nowhere near as memorable as Il Postino or La Bocca's stellar examples. 

Since these apps are a bit on the small side, the best bang for your buck to sate your hunger would be the mini pork shanks, followed closely by the prime rib dip. The artisan grilled cheese was my personal favorite (sooo perfectly buttery, sweet and savory!), but it really would have benefited from another little grilled brie sammich on the plate because they're quite small. 

Several of our party tried the wine (chard, pinot, merlot, and I think they've even got some bubbly) and had positive things to say. While we all had zero interest in trying the beer, since it was just PBR on draft or domestic swill in bottles. There were much better options to be had for three bucks, like the specialty cocktails! 

The waitress that took care of us was kind enough to explain what each of the cocktails entailed. Best liquor bang for your buck? The Hot 'N' Dirty, an extra dirty vodka martini with a splash of Tabasco and three olives. They even bring it out in a little cocktail shaker to pour tableside, ensuring that not a drop of goodness is wasted on the way to your table. Second most potent potable was the Bourbon Smash, a whiskey cocktail that's the illegitimate love child of a mojito and a mint julep. In the words of Sammy J, ""It'll getcha drunk!"" 

The Gin Fizz was one of the most refreshing cocktails, kind of a gin and tonic with more prominent citrus notes and a splash of simple syrup. And for the girlie girls in attendance, the Bramble, Basil Showbiz and Cherry Limeade will treat ya right! The Bramble was heavy on the blackberry, the Basil Showbiz strawberried out and the Cherry Limeade had me second guessing whether someone had spiked a Sonic limeade. Superb, one and all. I haven't a single bad word to say about any the cocktails taste-wise, although the more frou frou drinks seemed a bit light on the pour. 

Three dollar beer, wine, specialty cocktails and appetizers? A frenzy of (relatively sophisticated) gluttony? A mere 15 bucks. Cafe Zuzu is my new go-to for happy hour!"	15	10	16	['holi', 'effin', 'eff', 'best', 'happi', 'hour', 'anywher', 'valley', 'challeng', 'find', 'better', 'happi', 'hour', 'three', 'dollar', 'bonanza', 'cafe', 'zuzu', 'eat', 'one', 'wretch', 'pickl', 'egg', 'palo', 'verd', 'loung', 'graygreen', 'egg', 'time', 'forgotil', 'start', 'tapasstyl', 'appet', 'realli', 'blew', 'away', 'two', 'fallofthebon', 'tender', 'brais', 'pork', 'shank', 'melt', 'mouth', 'fill', 'belli', 'three', 'buck', 'surprisingli', 'ampl', 'mini', 'prime', 'rib', 'dip', 'unassum', 'horseradish', 'mayo', 'au', 'ju', 'three', 'buck', 'two', 'butteri', 'rich', 'grill', 'brie', 'thin', 'slice', 'green', 'appl', 'sandwich', 'fig', 'jam', 'reduct', 'three', 'buck', 'im', 'saliv', 'right', 'two', 'option', 'includ', 'border', 'chili', 'fresh', 'chunk', 'meat', 'bit', 'bland', 'compar', 'rest', 'app', 'bruschetta', 'utterli', 'forgett', 'standard', 'tomato', 'oliv', 'caper', 'nowher', 'near', 'memor', 'il', 'postino', 'la', 'bocca', 'stellar', 'exampl', 'sinc', 'app', 'bit', 'small', 'side', 'best', 'bang', 'buck', 'sate', 'hunger', 'would', 'mini', 'pork', 'shank', 'follow', 'close', 'prime', 'rib', 'dip', 'artisan', 'grill', 'chees', 'person', 'favorit', 'sooo', 'perfectli', 'butteri', 'sweet', 'savori', 'realli', 'would', 'benefit', 'anoth', 'littl', 'grill', 'brie', 'sammich', 'plate', 'theyr', 'quit', 'small', 'sever', 'parti', 'tri', 'wine', 'chard', 'pinot', 'merlot', 'think', 'theyv', 'even', 'got', 'bubbl', 'posit', 'thing', 'say', 'zero', 'interest', 'tri', 'beer', 'sinc', 'pbr', 'draft', 'domest', 'swill', 'bottl', 'much', 'better', 'option', 'three', 'buck', 'like', 'specialti', 'cocktail', 'waitress', 'took', 'care', 'us', 'kind', 'enough', 'explain', 'cocktail', 'entail', 'best', 'liquor', 'bang', 'buck', 'hot', 'n', 'dirti', 'extra', 'dirti', 'vodka', 'martini', 'splash', 'tabasco', 'three', 'oliv', 'even', 'bring', 'littl', 'cocktail', 'shaker', 'pour', 'tablesid', 'ensur', 'drop', 'good', 'wast', 'way', 'tabl', 'second', 'potent', 'potabl', 'bourbon', 'smash', 'whiskey', 'cocktail', 'that', 'illegitim', 'love', 'child', 'mojito', 'mint', 'julep', 'word', 'sammi', 'j', 'itll', 'getcha', 'drunk', 'gin', 'fizz', 'one', 'refresh', 'cocktail', 'kind', 'gin', 'tonic', 'promin', 'citru', 'note', 'splash', 'simpl', 'syrup', 'girli', 'girl', 'attend', 'brambl', 'basil', 'showbiz', 'cherri', 'limead', 'treat', 'ya', 'right', 'brambl', 'heavi', 'blackberri', 'basil', 'showbiz', 'strawberri', 'cherri', 'limead', 'second', 'guess', 'whether', 'someon', 'spike', 'sonic', 'limead', 'superb', 'one', 'havent', 'singl', 'bad', 'word', 'say', 'cocktail', 'tastewis', 'although', 'frou', 'frou', 'drink', 'seem', 'bit', 'light', 'pour', 'three', 'dollar', 'beer', 'wine', 'specialti', 'cocktail', 'appet', 'frenzi', 'rel', 'sophist', 'gluttoni', 'mere', 'buck', 'cafe', 'zuzu', 'new', 'goto', 'happi', 'hour']

Eww.

This exclamation should be accompanied by a scrunched up nose, sneer or depressed sigh depending on the intonation.

Does the smell of open sewage wafting from the bathrooms entice your tastebuds? Eww! *scrunchy nose*

Do shriveled potato skins, overcooked fried zucchini sticks, or soggy hot wings float your boat? Eww. *disdainful sneer*

Does the fact that they constantly change their specials and scheduled events without notice, luring you into this depressing hole under false pretenses sound dandy? Eww... *depressed sigh*

I live dangerously close to this place, so more often than not I'll end up here when there's a dispute along the veins of: ""Whatta you wanna do tonight? I dunno. How bout you?""

Most frequently this is the end decision on a Friday night, when they hold live trivia with a host and the opportunity to win 20 to 30 bucks if you come in first or second place. But it's difficult to enjoy some live trivia when it's canceled every other week without any prior notice. That kind of business ethic doesn't instill any loyalty in your customer base. It's also kind of trashy how our winning credits are always hand written in near illegible chicken scratch on a piece of register tape, only redeemable for food, and only on a day other than trivia time. I get it. You want to lure us back on a weekday so we'll spend money in the bar. Klassy.

I wouldn't have such a problem with the place if it the food was at least worth it. The nachos are huge and covered in lots of toppings but it's primarily cheap-o nacho cheese sauce or sour cream, which add little flavor and just make the whole thing a sloppy mess. The wings are soggy and generic (the hot isn't spicy in the least-- maybe they were referring to the temperature?), and there's an absolutely terrible Island Jerk flavor. The zucchini sticks are always overcooked and soggy. The cheese sticks are hard and chewy, not stringy mozzarella. The potato skins look like shriveled little potato abortions adorned by three bacon bits and some nacho sauce. The pizza is pretty decent and probably your best bet. I wouldn't recommend anything else on the menu. They use cheap, bargain basement product and it shows in the quality of the food.

That leaves the bar to make up for the abysmal food. Too bad that's pretty hit or miss, with an emphasis on the miss. For about a two month stretch Sneakers seemed to change their daily specials week by week if not day by day. One day it would be two dollar ladies mixed drinks all day, next week just 9pm to close. Then it would be two dollar drafts all day, changed to half priced wings during happy hour. I don't like the bait and switch. I understand that a new or struggling place needs to cut costs and redefine its specials but when it's changing that often (too quickly for even the signage on the tables or menus to keep up) there's a serious issue with management that needs to be addressed. 

It seems like they've finally settled things to 75 cent domestic draft beers during happy hour (Coors and Bud) and half priced appetizers. Solid. Then from 9pm to close the daily drink specials start. Good. Keep it simple, stupid.

The service at least tries to make up for the crappy food and ever changing drink specials. They're always more than patient when it comes to explaining the changes and always apologetic when they get the brunt of our disappointment when we've been victims of the ole bait and switch. 

The decor looks like a tacky college sports fan decorated it with all the tables sporting different teams and mascots, and paraphernalia splashed all over the walls willy nilly. There's also a weird identity problem going on, with some cheap wine prints on display in the bar and a gigantic statue of Uncle Lester from the Addams Family dressed in a referee suit. They offer Rock Band but I've never seen anyone playing it. They offer the Buzztime Trivia but hardly any televisions are ever tuned to it. There's a couple pool tables, darts, a basketball game, Buck Hunter and a couple other video games in the back. It just seems to be having an extreme identity crisis, trying to be something different to everyone, but half assing it so no one ends up satisfied.

They've taken to serving beer in plastic cups and giving out paper plates for food during happy hour which is a bit on the depressing side. The general vibe makes it seem like it's on the brink of closing any given week, which is too bad because they easily have one of the best patios in Tempe. 

If you're going to go, sit on the patio and enjoy the greenery, cool water, friendly ducks and turtles sunning themselves.

Not very comfortable to dine in, but cutesy nonetheless. It also helps that I now work in the surrounding area, since Munch-a-Lunch seems to cater exclusively to the business parks around it. Although it's nothing to write home about, it does a pretty fine job of sating my hunger.

This small hole-in-the-wall joint caters to those on the go with a five dollar sandwich box that consists of a sammich, bag o' chips, candy bar and canned soda. It's a screaming deal compared to most fast food meal deal prices, and you can be in and out in a few minutes. However, if you're willing to wait around a bit (and maybe try out those funky butterfly chairs or watch an old black and white movie on the tele inside), the made to order specials and salads are usually pretty solid and a good bang for your lunch buck. 

One gripe I have with this place is that the consistency is wildly variable depending on the day. I've ordered the Greek salad numerous times (what can I say, I'm a sucker for beets in a salad) and it's been nigh inedible at times due to a heavy hand with the salty dressing and feta cheese. So order dressing on the side if you're a featherweight like me. At times some items have been a bit stale as well. I've had some unfortunate puff pastry that seemed like it had been freezer burned or microwaved a hair too long. And they have a strange propensity for smothering things in sour cream sauce. 

These are little issues in the overall quality of the food though. Sandwiches and salads are always a solid bet, and the Greek menu items have rarely let me down! 

Give it a shot if you're in the area. There's worse things you could do to yourself for five bucks."	3	2	3	['would', 'never', 'known', 'establish', 'exist', 'wasnt', 'small', 'dine', 'area', 'front', 'umbrella', 'strang', 'wroughtiron', 'flutterbi', 'dragonfli', 'shape', 'chair', 'tabl', 'comfort', 'dine', 'cutesi', 'nonetheless', 'also', 'help', 'work', 'surround', 'area', 'sinc', 'munchalunch', 'seem', 'cater', 'exclus', 'busi', 'park', 'around', 'although', 'noth', 'write', 'home', 'pretti', 'fine', 'job', 'sate', 'hungerthi', 'small', 'holeinthewal', 'joint', 'cater', 'go', 'five', 'dollar', 'sandwich', 'box', 'consist', 'sammich', 'bag', 'chip', 'candi', 'bar', 'can', 'soda', 'scream', 'deal', 'compar', 'fast', 'food', 'meal', 'deal', 'price', 'minut', 'howev', 'your', 'will', 'wait', 'around', 'bit', 'mayb', 'tri', 'funki', 'butterfli', 'chair', 'watch', 'old', 'black', 'white', 'movi', 'tele', 'insid', 'made', 'order', 'special', 'salad', 'usual', 'pretti', 'solid', 'good', 'bang', 'lunch', 'buck', 'one', 'gripe', 'place', 'consist', 'wildli', 'variabl', 'depend', 'day', 'ive', 'order', 'greek', 'salad', 'numer', 'time', 'say', 'im', 'sucker', 'beet', 'salad', 'nigh', 'ined', 'time', 'due', 'heavi', 'hand', 'salti', 'dress', 'feta', 'chees', 'order', 'dress', 'side', 'your', 'featherweight', 'like', 'time', 'item', 'bit', 'stale', 'well', 'ive', 'unfortun', 'puff', 'pastri', 'seem', 'like', 'freezer', 'burn', 'microwav', 'hair', 'long', 'strang', 'propens', 'smother', 'thing', 'sour', 'cream', 'sauc', 'littl', 'issu', 'overal', 'qualiti', 'food', 'though', 'sandwich', 'salad', 'alway', 'solid', 'bet', 'greek', 'menu', 'item', 'rare', 'let', 'give', 'shot', 'your', 'area', 'there', 'wors', 'thing', 'could', 'five', 'buck']

Let me reign in my enthusiasm a bit. I don't generally like Ross. It's trashy, unorganized and sticky. Especially the one in Arizona Mills Mall. (I shudder remembering trying to redeem my gift card there last Christmas. Long lines, cheap whorebag\/old granny clothes galore, and it was infested with children.) Typically the majority of clothes at Ross look like they could also be found hanging in my local Goodwill, but I still frequent these crappy stores in hopes of finding a killer deal. (What can I say? I'm a masochist. They keep burning me over, and over and I just line up for the punishment.)

But this shiny new location in Tempe Marketplace and I are undergoing a golden honeymoon period!

It just opened so all the fixtures are new and not covered in human grime yet. The clothes here are surprisingly well organized for this type of scavenger hunt shopping experience. I found my sizes exactly where they should be, a first for any Ross-venture. The clothes here are of the same cheap, thin poly-cotton blends that allows them to keep their prices so low, but they've always lasted a fair amount of time and for the price simply can't be beat. The fashions thankfully aren't still stuck in the late 90s era of baby doll tees, and I managed to find pretty dresses for a wedding, Zombie Prom and for when I want to feel like a tulle entwined princess, all for only 40 bucks! Ross is also pretty good for decorating a bathroom, kitchen or living room on the cheap. And the accessories section at this location rocks. Tons of purses, shoes and jewlery.

So if you're looking for cheap clothes and house accessories that haven't already been pawed at by the masses, go here. Quick! Before it starts to reek of feet and small children."	6	10	3	['three', 'parti', 'dress', 'buck', 'im', 'bell', 'ball', 'bitcheslet', 'reign', 'enthusiasm', 'bit', 'dont', 'gener', 'like', 'ross', 'trashi', 'unorgan', 'sticki', 'especi', 'one', 'arizona', 'mill', 'mall', 'shudder', 'rememb', 'tri', 'redeem', 'gift', 'card', 'last', 'christma', 'long', 'line', 'cheap', 'whorebagold', 'granni', 'cloth', 'galor', 'infest', 'children', 'typic', 'major', 'cloth', 'ross', 'look', 'like', 'could', 'also', 'found', 'hang', 'local', 'goodwil', 'still', 'frequent', 'crappi', 'store', 'hope', 'find', 'killer', 'deal', 'say', 'im', 'masochist', 'keep', 'burn', 'line', 'punishmentbut', 'shini', 'new', 'locat', 'temp', 'marketplac', 'undergo', 'golden', 'honeymoon', 'periodit', 'open', 'fixtur', 'new', 'cover', 'human', 'grime', 'yet', 'cloth', 'surprisingli', 'well', 'organ', 'type', 'scaveng', 'hunt', 'shop', 'experi', 'found', 'size', 'exactli', 'first', 'rossventur', 'cloth', 'cheap', 'thin', 'polycotton', 'blend', 'allow', 'keep', 'price', 'low', 'theyv', 'alway', 'last', 'fair', 'amount', 'time', 'price', 'simpli', 'cant', 'beat', 'fashion', 'thank', 'arent', 'still', 'stuck', 'late', 'era', 'babi', 'doll', 'tee', 'manag', 'find', 'pretti', 'dress', 'wed', 'zombi', 'prom', 'want', 'feel', 'like', 'tull', 'entwin', 'princess', 'buck', 'ross', 'also', 'pretti', 'good', 'decor', 'bathroom', 'kitchen', 'live', 'room', 'cheap', 'accessori', 'section', 'locat', 'rock', 'ton', 'purs', 'shoe', 'jewleryso', 'your', 'look', 'cheap', 'cloth', 'hous', 'accessori', 'havent', 'alreadi', 'paw', 'mass', 'go', 'quick', 'start', 'reek', 'feet', 'small', 'children']

To avoid compromising the values of my veggie friends by forcing them to make me man meat, it's always best to choose a place with plenty of greens on the menu. Pita Jungle is the perfect harmony between flesh renders and herbivores. And it doesn't just have the ""hold the chicken"" type vegg friendly option on the menu, it's got lentils and shit.

Now, since we've already established that I live under rocks, you can just go ahead and assume I've never been to Pita Jungle. What can I say, the grub hunting was good. But after my first visit you can bet your skinny little vegan ass I'll be noshing right next to you on a regular basis. 

The restaurant has apparently expanded twice since it's been open and it was still hoppin' last night, with an open, airy feel and interesting artwork decorating the walls. We hovered over the seating section booth thingy and were told to go ahead and steal any open seat we liked. Some may find this annoying and unorganized, but I really like it when they let me do that part of their job for them, so we snagged a table for two right next to the window so I could watch some dog TV, which was showing a tig old biddy sorority girl special based on the number of perky young freshman coming and going in the parking lot. (Side note: Big old windows are like big screen dog TVs because dogs don't watch human TV, they keep track of the cats trotting through their territory and bark at the mailman and monitor the comings and goings of the neighborhood through windows. At least in my experience. I'll be sitting there glued to the tube and the dogs will be sitting there glued to the window. End tangent. Thanks for your patience.)

Others have complained about the poor service at this location, but surprise (sarcasm) Mr. Man ends up knowing the waiter assigned to our section, so we were promptly rewarded with menus and drinks. Not that I would have even noticed the wait since I was agape, trying to take in everything offered on a menu that just wouldn't quit. Eventually I grabbed hold of my indecision and narrowed it down to three options, the black bean burger, the lavosh shawarma wrap, or the Caribbean salad. We agreed that not having hummus simply wasn't an option so I went with the shawarma so I could pep it up with some left over hummus, and I really dig lavosh because it reminds me of saltines, which I don't really like that much, but are scrumptious in flatbread form. Mr. Man decided upon the grilled vegetable salad, because if you've ever met him, he really needs to watch his boyish figure (again, sarcasm).

We ordered an extra pita for the hummus, which was overkill and we didn't even end up touching it because the ""small hummus"" ended up being freakin' huge and the pita was sized to match. It was smooth and creamy, and garnished with two of my favorite vegetables (or whatever an olive technically is), cucumbers and kalamata olives! My one gripe about the entire meal was that my chicken was overly dry and a smidgen bland, but the hummus more than made up for that lack in flavor. The side Greek salad that came with my wrap was also stupendous, with a hefty amount of feta and a delicious, light vinaigrette to counter that richness. Mr. Man's grilled vegetable salad was also very well done, with crisp veggies, lots of garlic and an awesome dressing. 

And this delish bounty of fresh, healthy food came to 20 bucks between the two of us and left us with enough leftovers for lunch tomorrow. I'll definitely be coming here again, and frequently, so I can get my daily dose of granola crunching hippies, sorority sisters, cooler than thou hipsters and SUV driving yuppies with their childrens all in one place.

Short and thick  with an au naturel casing? They got that too. 

Thin, floppy and tasting of meatloaf? Hey, whatever gets your rocks off.

Word to the wise, Schreiner's is a small mom and pop and they only take cash, check (crazy, right?), or debit cards. No credit will be extended to your broke ass. And if you want to use your debit card you have to gather up at least ten bucks worth of meat in your hot little paws before they'll run the card. Don't worry, it's more than easy to do.

There were no belly dancers or tarot card readers, both dinner time lures advertised upon entering, since the noon-to-one crowd is generally geared toward the white collar crowd. That eliminated the possibility of a razzle dazzle performance that may have lured another star out of me, leaving the service, ambiance and food to shine on their own.

The service was adequate. Not really much to say either way on that. I did kind of like the fact that the wait staff was all eating there in a family setting and were just finishing up when I arrived. That immediately raised my expectations, since they wouldn't settle for anything nasty. Also, the kitchen was filled with....Turks! Not a single word of Spanish, which is quite an anomaly in the food service business. Again, my expectations raised.

Upon entering, the customer is given the option of sitting at regular or low seating. I highly recommend the latter, as it consists of plush pillows and short stools arranged around round tables. The main dining area is very open air with warm colors and sparse decorations, but it feels more sterile than the environment created in the adjacent rooms. Within these rooms comfortable open booths and pillows, upholstered in dark, rich colors are accented by decorative lighting that could have been bought from a bazaar and transported straight here. The layout of these side rooms adds to the ambiance and present plenty of opportunity for conversation. 

We all ordered lunch specials, which are composed of rice, pita bread, cabbage slaw and a meat of some sort. The lamb that I ordered was a little on the bland side and stringy. It would have done much better stewed than grilled. I would also highly recommend you trade the plain ole white rice for the biriani rice, which is saffron (turmeric?) based with veggie bits and walnuts. It was savory and scrumptious, the exact opposite of the cabbage slaw, which was an odd combination of vinegar, mint and garlic. It was a little pricey for a lunch special, ringing in at $10.95 without beverages, and the dinner specials are even more expensive.

I would come here a second time for the atmosphere, and maybe for the belly dancing, but I would definitely try something else off the menu."	1	0	1	['work', 'buddi', 'decid', 'go', 'lark', 'lunch', 'today', 'sinc', 'crave', 'someth', 'outsid', 'tradit', 'americana', 'fare', 'everyth', 'thought', 'would', 'henc', 'averag', 'number', 'star', 'belli', 'dancer', 'tarot', 'card', 'reader', 'dinner', 'time', 'lure', 'advertis', 'upon', 'enter', 'sinc', 'noontoon', 'crowd', 'gener', 'gear', 'toward', 'white', 'collar', 'crowd', 'elimin', 'possibl', 'razzl', 'dazzl', 'perform', 'may', 'lure', 'anoth', 'star', 'leav', 'servic', 'ambianc', 'food', 'shine', 'ownth', 'servic', 'adequ', 'realli', 'much', 'say', 'either', 'way', 'kind', 'like', 'fact', 'wait', 'staff', 'eat', 'famili', 'set', 'finish', 'arriv', 'immedi', 'rais', 'expect', 'sinc', 'wouldnt', 'settl', 'anyth', 'nasti', 'also', 'kitchen', 'fill', 'withturk', 'singl', 'word', 'spanish', 'quit', 'anomali', 'food', 'servic', 'busi', 'expect', 'raisedupon', 'enter', 'custom', 'given', 'option', 'sit', 'regular', 'low', 'seat', 'highli', 'recommend', 'latter', 'consist', 'plush', 'pillow', 'short', 'stool', 'arrang', 'around', 'round', 'tabl', 'main', 'dine', 'area', 'open', 'air', 'warm', 'color', 'spars', 'decor', 'feel', 'steril', 'environ', 'creat', 'adjac', 'room', 'within', 'room', 'comfort', 'open', 'booth', 'pillow', 'upholst', 'dark', 'rich', 'color', 'accent', 'decor', 'light', 'could', 'bought', 'bazaar', 'transport', 'straight', 'layout', 'side', 'room', 'add', 'ambianc', 'present', 'plenti', 'opportun', 'convers', 'order', 'lunch', 'special', 'compos', 'rice', 'pita', 'bread', 'cabbag', 'slaw', 'meat', 'sort', 'lamb', 'order', 'littl', 'bland', 'side', 'stringi', 'would', 'done', 'much', 'better', 'stew', 'grill', 'would', 'also', 'highli', 'recommend', 'trade', 'plain', 'ole', 'white', 'rice', 'biriani', 'rice', 'saffron', 'turmer', 'base', 'veggi', 'bit', 'walnut', 'savori', 'scrumptiou', 'exact', 'opposit', 'cabbag', 'slaw', 'odd', 'combin', 'vinegar', 'mint', 'garlic', 'littl', 'pricey', 'lunch', 'special', 'ring', 'without', 'beverag', 'dinner', 'special', 'even', 'expensivei', 'would', 'come', 'second', 'time', 'atmospher', 'mayb', 'belli', 'danc', 'would', 'definit', 'tri', 'someth', 'els', 'menu']

It is unlikely any of you will find yourself here in the near future and hopefully not even in the far future, as this is where vitality goes to die. But if you find yourself with a flat tire out in the middle of BFE or need to take Grandma out for a night on the town (bedtime by 8pm at the latest, sonny!), this is a pretty respectable choice. And in full confidentiality, it managed to surprise me.
-----------------------------------------------------------

I can't fathom why, but my family resides in the suburban sprawl of Peoria, which happens to border Sun City. I haven't been out to this haven for golf carts and cataracts since I used to live way out in northwest Glendale, but for my stepmother's birthday she wanted to eat at Little Bite of Italy. So we pile in to the car for the mini road trip out there from Tempe.

Having arrived early, Mr. Man and I saunter up to the bar and (gasp!) get carded. Seeing how we were mere babes in the womb compared to some of the patrons there, this was no big surprise. What was surprising was the house sauvignon blanc I ordered that tasted like sweet tarts. And cost a whopping $6.50 for a bitsy little glass. Whatevs. Old people's livers don't work as well as mine, so I can see how they can get away with upping the price.

I was also surprised at this freaky gigantic beer tap that was ordered for the table. It seemed like a little bit of frat boy flava delivered to a demographic that could be their parents or grandparents. It was a wicked cool cylindrical device that held three pitchers and had a chilled center at the base. A gigantic bong of of booze if you will.

Since I'm indecisive I went with the sampler: meat lasagna, chicken parmesan and fettuccine alfredo. Aside from the fact that it needed salt (again, my blood pressure probably isn't as high as the older folks), the meal was pretty tasty. The alfredo was lackluster, but I've rarely had good alfredo from a restaurant so it was no surprise. I also grazed on a piece of The Works pizza with sausage, pepperoni, onions, mushroom, red and green peppers. That was far superior and the left over pizza reheated to a lovely crisp in the oven the next day.

The entertainment was probably the highlight of the evening. There was a 50+ (don't want to offend by guessing wrong), petite female performer in what could have doubled as a figure skating outfit singing her little heart out on stage. She had a great voice, oozed mature sex appeal all over the male customers (no need for viagra that night) and took requests like the pro she was. All ages were shakin' what their momma gave them up in front of the stage, me included, and it was a surprising amount of fun.

I never knew Sun City could be so spry!

I know, why call it a dive if there aren't painted-up hussies propped on bar stools and you're not afraid to contract something lasting from touching the bathroom features? Because it's more like that neglected house down the street owned by the Cat Lady that has chipped paint and an overgrown yard, but when you stop there on Halloween she always has those awesome popcorn balls. Or that ottoman that's a little frayed around the edges and is patched with duct tape to keep the upholstery skirt on, but it's the comfiest damn foot rest. 

Despite the looks, the bar is a local watering hole that attracts your quirky neighbors. Someone brought in the pelt of a javelina they'd shot the day prior to show it off to his buddies. Ever seen one of those ugly things up close? You just might get the chance if you decide to check it out. Chuy's two doors down will serve as a neon-lit mecca for mass consumption, while Baseline Pub will remain the watering hole in the wall that's a little more mellow and a little rougher around the edges.

Happy hour is twelve hours long, from ten to ten, so they don't really have any drink specials, but the prices are cheap so that's not really an issue. Plus there's the requisite pool tables that every good dive has, so you've got something to occupy your time in addition to conversation with the locals.

The down side is that the mixed drinks are a bit on the weak side, so stick with beer. The music selection kind of sucks at times, with either country western or classic rock playing. (Cross your fingers for the classic rock.) The waitresses are pretty inattentive as well, so make sure there aren't any lapses in conversation, because silence sure drags long without something to quench your thirst."	5	4	2	['your', 'look', 'dive', 'bar', 'without', 'skeez', 'layer', 'thick', 'consid', 'gem', 'know', 'call', 'dive', 'arent', 'paintedup', 'hussi', 'prop', 'bar', 'stool', 'your', 'afraid', 'contract', 'someth', 'last', 'touch', 'bathroom', 'featur', 'like', 'neglect', 'hous', 'street', 'own', 'cat', 'ladi', 'chip', 'paint', 'overgrown', 'yard', 'stop', 'halloween', 'alway', 'awesom', 'popcorn', 'ball', 'ottoman', 'that', 'littl', 'fray', 'around', 'edg', 'patch', 'duct', 'tape', 'keep', 'upholsteri', 'skirt', 'comfiest', 'damn', 'foot', 'rest', 'despit', 'look', 'bar', 'local', 'water', 'hole', 'attract', 'quirki', 'neighbor', 'someon', 'brought', 'pelt', 'javelina', 'theyd', 'shot', 'day', 'prior', 'show', 'buddi', 'ever', 'seen', 'one', 'ugli', 'thing', 'close', 'might', 'get', 'chanc', 'decid', 'check', 'chuy', 'two', 'door', 'serv', 'neonlit', 'mecca', 'mass', 'consumpt', 'baselin', 'pub', 'remain', 'water', 'hole', 'wall', 'that', 'littl', 'mellow', 'littl', 'rougher', 'around', 'edgeshappi', 'hour', 'twelv', 'hour', 'long', 'ten', 'ten', 'dont', 'realli', 'drink', 'special', 'price', 'cheap', 'that', 'realli', 'issu', 'plu', 'there', 'requisit', 'pool', 'tabl', 'everi', 'good', 'dive', 'youv', 'got', 'someth', 'occupi', 'time', 'addit', 'convers', 'localsth', 'side', 'mix', 'drink', 'bit', 'weak', 'side', 'stick', 'beer', 'music', 'select', 'kind', 'suck', 'time', 'either', 'countri', 'western', 'classic', 'rock', 'play', 'cross', 'finger', 'classic', 'rock', 'waitress', 'pretti', 'inattent', 'well', 'make', 'sure', 'arent', 'laps', 'convers', 'silenc', 'sure', 'drag', 'long', 'without', 'someth', 'quench', 'thirst']

You let me mix n' match my heart's desire.

As bombers, pints and fifths sure spark a fire.
This social lube you offer is smooth n' cheap,
From Champagne, Brewski, Liquor to Wine.
Clever, friendly staff if asked for help will leap,
And serve impending hangovers of mine.

I use extreme in the sense that there's 100s of options that all end in AWESOME. White peach iced AWESOME, iced pomegran-AWESOME, four AWESOME berry tea, creme brulAWESOME. And those are just the flavors I've sampled. I could be ""The Richmeister"" from SNL while lavishing praises upon these teas.

Going with the white peach-a-rino, iced pomegrana-rama-ding-dong, the creme brulee-ster, four berries? Berry nice. Makin' the copies...

But I digress.

Tea Infusion has an awesome location in terms of drawing in business, so all you naysayers that are poo pooing its place nestled among chain stores can just shut it. From a business perspective it makes perfect sense. People get thirsty when shopping, especially in the desert, and this place appears like an oasis on the horizon. If it was a dinky little independent establishment it would never receive the exposure that it does at Tempe Marketplace and probably would have a hard time staying solvent, regardless of how much we adoring Yelpers build it up. So I'd rather laud the smarts of a business man who broke through the corporate mold and managed to offer an independent and hip lil tea shop amid the brand name wasteland that is Tempe Marketplace than complain about it. 

It's so nice to step into this place, breath a sigh of relief and shake off the oppressive crowd of consumers (and anklebiters) waiting just outside that door, especially if it's a weekend evening. And I've got to say that a nice cuppa makes the window shopping, caterwauling live band, and gaggles of giggling adolescents much more enjoyable.

Aside from a tea selection that puts China Mist to shame, they offer some munchitos that I've never indulged in like sandwiches, sides and scrumptious looking desserts. One day, Tea Infusion, one day.

The only complaint I have is with the staff. 

I understand you don't make much and sometimes customers are devilish. I've been a barista before. But that's no excuse to neglect your customers or the cleanliness of your establishment. I went on a Saturday night and one chick was very loudly and obnoxiously chatting up a customer, leaving her coworker to fall behind when handling group after group of people by his lonesome. The counter was filthy and cluttered with tea paraphernalia, smoothie stuff, dirty steeping devices, and milk that someone had neglected to put back in the refrigerator. I wanted to jump behind the counter, tidy up that terrible mess and help a dude out, then give that flirty flit at the end of the counter a piece of my mind. 

I get the disenfranchisement you feel when being paid slightly over minimum wage, but have a little respect for customer service and the integrity of your shop or you won't have one to report to for long."	16	8	8	['everi', 'time', 'go', 'waltz', 'around', 'district', 'ahem', 'twice', 'make', 'sure', 'stop', 'hidden', 'gem', 'extrem', 'ice', 'tea', 'action', 'use', 'extrem', 'sens', 'there', 'option', 'end', 'awesom', 'white', 'peach', 'ice', 'awesom', 'ice', 'pomegranawesom', 'four', 'awesom', 'berri', 'tea', 'creme', 'brulawesom', 'flavor', 'ive', 'sampl', 'could', 'richmeist', 'snl', 'lavish', 'prais', 'upon', 'teasgo', 'white', 'peacharino', 'ice', 'pomegranaramadingdong', 'creme', 'bruleest', 'four', 'berri', 'berri', 'nice', 'makin', 'copiesbut', 'digresstea', 'infus', 'awesom', 'locat', 'term', 'draw', 'busi', 'naysay', 'poo', 'poo', 'place', 'nestl', 'among', 'chain', 'store', 'shut', 'busi', 'perspect', 'make', 'perfect', 'sens', 'peopl', 'get', 'thirsti', 'shop', 'especi', 'desert', 'place', 'appear', 'like', 'oasi', 'horizon', 'dinki', 'littl', 'independ', 'establish', 'would', 'never', 'receiv', 'exposur', 'temp', 'marketplac', 'probabl', 'would', 'hard', 'time', 'stay', 'solvent', 'regardless', 'much', 'ador', 'yelper', 'build', 'id', 'rather', 'laud', 'smart', 'busi', 'man', 'broke', 'corpor', 'mold', 'manag', 'offer', 'independ', 'hip', 'lil', 'tea', 'shop', 'amid', 'brand', 'name', 'wasteland', 'temp', 'marketplac', 'complain', 'nice', 'step', 'place', 'breath', 'sigh', 'relief', 'shake', 'oppress', 'crowd', 'consum', 'anklebit', 'wait', 'outsid', 'door', 'especi', 'weekend', 'even', 'ive', 'got', 'say', 'nice', 'cuppa', 'make', 'window', 'shop', 'caterwaul', 'live', 'band', 'gaggl', 'giggl', 'adolesc', 'much', 'enjoyableasid', 'tea', 'select', 'put', 'china', 'mist', 'shame', 'offer', 'munchito', 'ive', 'never', 'indulg', 'like', 'sandwich', 'side', 'scrumptiou', 'look', 'dessert', 'one', 'day', 'tea', 'infus', 'one', 'dayth', 'complaint', 'staff', 'understand', 'dont', 'make', 'much', 'sometim', 'custom', 'devilish', 'ive', 'barista', 'that', 'excus', 'neglect', 'custom', 'cleanli', 'establish', 'went', 'saturday', 'night', 'one', 'chick', 'loudli', 'obnoxi', 'chat', 'custom', 'leav', 'cowork', 'fall', 'behind', 'handl', 'group', 'group', 'peopl', 'lonesom', 'counter', 'filthi', 'clutter', 'tea', 'paraphernalia', 'smoothi', 'stuff', 'dirti', 'steep', 'devic', 'milk', 'someon', 'neglect', 'put', 'back', 'refriger', 'want', 'jump', 'behind', 'counter', 'tidi', 'terribl', 'mess', 'help', 'dude', 'give', 'flirti', 'flit', 'end', 'counter', 'piec', 'mind', 'get', 'disenfranchis', 'feel', 'paid', 'slightli', 'minimum', 'wage', 'littl', 'respect', 'custom', 'servic', 'integr', 'shop', 'wont', 'one', 'report', 'long']

If pho is in your future, be forewarned that the serving sizes are massive. I have never been able to polish off an entire bowl. So come extra hungry and skip the tempting spring rolls (also delicious with a killer spicy peanut sauce). Because if you've ever made the mistake of trying to stretch out a bowl of pho by taking half of it home, you know the disappointment that comes along with that cloudy bowl of watered down leftovers. Rice noodles just don't hold up well. Le sigh.

Lately I've taken to phoning in my order and picking up my Pho To Go (someone needs to snatch up that name, stat!) at the same price as the dine in option ($6-8). I have discovered the secret to pho longevity this way. Noodles and beefy parts are packaged separately and the broth is also in its own container. Nothing gets water logged and cloudy and I can easily make four meals out of one order. They toss in all the baggies of goodness too!

Can ambiance and service compensate for sub par food at ridiculous prices? Oh, the dilemma! I like the beautiful decor and attentive service, but I also like reasonably priced entrees with discernable flavor. Let's see...nope. Well that didn't take very long to decide.

I've eaten at this location several times. The last time was with a very large group of people, and I got to try many different things off the menu. It basically boiled down to two flavor categories: spicy or non-spicy. The spicy dishes tasted like they had been prepared in one stock sauce. The non-spicy dishes tasted like they had been prepared in a similar sauce that omitted the chili oil. Here and there they added other things, like black bean paste or some sweetness, but most of the dishes tasted pretty much the same. I suppose this is why the menu doesn't go into detail when describing the difference between entrees, just listing ""Mongolian Chicken"" or ""BC Hot and Spicy Chicken,"" since just the veggies and protein are interchangeable and no really strong flavor characterizes any one dish. 

We started off with the appetizer sampler: Sesame Honey Chicken, BC Egg Rolls, Coconut Shrimp, and Pot Stickers. Everything was perfectly adequate and worth the price since it served 4 people. The chicken was crispy, sweet and sprinkled with sesame seeds. The egg rolls tasted like they had been fried in old oil, but I fixed that by dousing it in hot mustard. The coconut shrimp were thin, crunchy, and not too sweet. The pot stickers were steamed with a delicious pork filling, probably the best thing on the tray. It was all pretty good filler before the meal. But it's kind of a sad affair when the appetizers trump the actual main course...

Everything came out really fast for a group of nine people and was piping hot. We shared it family style and here's the details, from best entree to worst:
*Cantonese Noodles- Wicked fricken good! If I end up going again, I'm definitely ordering this dish. Shrimp, scallops, BBQ pork, chicken and Asian vegetables with wheat noodles tossed in a light but flavorful sauce.
*Grilled Halibut- Well cooked and flaky. Mango and pineapple salsa was decent and the presentation was very well done.
*Chicken with Asparagus- I was barely able to distinguish the black bean sauce it was supposedly cooked in, but the chicken was tender and the asparagus al dente. 
*BC Spicy Chicken- This falls under the 'spicy' category of food flavoring. It was a little spicy, a little sweet, and very generic. Supposedly their equivalent of 'Kung Pao,' but it tasted...weirder than any other Kung Pao I've had. 
*Mandarin Orange Scallops- Tough and overcooked, same flavors as the BC Spicy Chicken but with more sugar and no kick. The crispy spinach was interesting though.
*Bamboo Bejing Duck- It was overcooked and dry rather than being crispy. The Asian pancakes were also dry, but the accompanying plum sauce lubricated things well enough. 
*Pad Thai Rice Noodles- Turned into a sticky noodle block after the first couple minutes. I've made the equivalent from a box in the 'Asian foods' aisle at Fry's. 
*Thai Curry Chicken and Shrimp- The Bamboo Club needs to focus on their Chinese offerings instead of their piss poor Thai dishes. Not good by any stretch of the imagination.

The side dishes were, like the appetizers, respectable but not amazing. The Dynasty Fried Rice tasted a lot like any other fried rice you'd order. No surprise or disappointment there. The Woked Mushrooms were very well cooked in a light sauce. Much better than most of the entrees even though it was a side dish. The Woked Asparagus had the same flavor as the mushrooms, both of which tasted suspiciously similar to the Chicken with Asparagus. Perhaps it just lacked the dollop of black bean paste?

So if you go, go for the ambiance. The patio is nice for Mill Avenue people watching and secluded enough to enjoy your meal with a little privacy. The service is attentive and quick to refill any glass or comply with your requests, even for a large group of people. At the very least these guys deserve the high tips generated by pricy entrees. It's too bad the food is so damn generic. Definitely not worth the 13-25 dollar price tag per entree. 

Maybe happy hour is the best option for attending this place? Cheap three dollar appetizers and drink specials without the unnecessary disappointment of crappy food? Maybe I'll give it a whirl in the future.

If you're wrangled into dinner there, go with the Cantonese noodles, crispy spinach and woked veggies. Best stuff on the menu. Or risk it and order something else. Maybe I went on an off night...but I doubt it since this is a corporate chain the same the country over."	5	4	4	['bamboo', 'club', 'got', 'mix', 'ambianc', 'servic', 'compens', 'sub', 'par', 'food', 'ridicul', 'price', 'oh', 'dilemma', 'like', 'beauti', 'decor', 'attent', 'servic', 'also', 'like', 'reason', 'price', 'entre', 'discern', 'flavor', 'let', 'seenop', 'well', 'didnt', 'take', 'long', 'decid', 'eaten', 'locat', 'sever', 'time', 'last', 'time', 'larg', 'group', 'peopl', 'got', 'tri', 'mani', 'differ', 'thing', 'menu', 'basic', 'boil', 'two', 'flavor', 'categori', 'spici', 'nonspici', 'spici', 'dish', 'tast', 'like', 'prepar', 'one', 'stock', 'sauc', 'nonspici', 'dish', 'tast', 'like', 'prepar', 'similar', 'sauc', 'omit', 'chili', 'oil', 'ad', 'thing', 'like', 'black', 'bean', 'past', 'sweet', 'dish', 'tast', 'pretti', 'much', 'suppos', 'menu', 'doesnt', 'go', 'detail', 'describ', 'differ', 'entre', 'list', 'mongolian', 'chicken', 'bc', 'hot', 'spici', 'chicken', 'sinc', 'veggi', 'protein', 'interchang', 'realli', 'strong', 'flavor', 'character', 'one', 'dish', 'start', 'appet', 'sampler', 'sesam', 'honey', 'chicken', 'bc', 'egg', 'roll', 'coconut', 'shrimp', 'pot', 'sticker', 'everyth', 'perfectli', 'adequ', 'worth', 'price', 'sinc', 'serv', 'peopl', 'chicken', 'crispi', 'sweet', 'sprinkl', 'sesam', 'seed', 'egg', 'roll', 'tast', 'like', 'fri', 'old', 'oil', 'fix', 'dous', 'hot', 'mustard', 'coconut', 'shrimp', 'thin', 'crunchi', 'sweet', 'pot', 'sticker', 'steam', 'delici', 'pork', 'fill', 'probabl', 'best', 'thing', 'tray', 'pretti', 'good', 'filler', 'meal', 'kind', 'sad', 'affair', 'appet', 'trump', 'actual', 'main', 'courseeveryth', 'came', 'realli', 'fast', 'group', 'nine', 'peopl', 'pipe', 'hot', 'share', 'famili', 'style', 'here', 'detail', 'best', 'entre', 'worstcantones', 'noodl', 'wick', 'fricken', 'good', 'end', 'go', 'im', 'definit', 'order', 'dish', 'shrimp', 'scallop', 'bbq', 'pork', 'chicken', 'asian', 'veget', 'wheat', 'noodl', 'toss', 'light', 'flavor', 'saucegril', 'halibut', 'well', 'cook', 'flaki', 'mango', 'pineappl', 'salsa', 'decent', 'present', 'well', 'donechicken', 'asparagu', 'bare', 'abl', 'distinguish', 'black', 'bean', 'sauc', 'supposedli', 'cook', 'chicken', 'tender', 'asparagu', 'al', 'dent', 'bc', 'spici', 'chicken', 'fall', 'spici', 'categori', 'food', 'flavor', 'littl', 'spici', 'littl', 'sweet', 'gener', 'supposedli', 'equival', 'kung', 'pao', 'tastedweird', 'kung', 'pao', 'ive', 'mandarin', 'orang', 'scallop', 'tough', 'overcook', 'flavor', 'bc', 'spici', 'chicken', 'sugar', 'kick', 'crispi', 'spinach', 'interest', 'thoughbamboo', 'beje', 'duck', 'overcook', 'dri', 'rather', 'crispi', 'asian', 'pancak', 'also', 'dri', 'accompani', 'plum', 'sauc', 'lubric', 'thing', 'well', 'enough', 'pad', 'thai', 'rice', 'noodl', 'turn', 'sticki', 'noodl', 'block', 'first', 'coupl', 'minut', 'ive', 'made', 'equival', 'box', 'asian', 'food', 'aisl', 'fri', 'thai', 'curri', 'chicken', 'shrimp', 'bamboo', 'club', 'need', 'focu', 'chines', 'offer', 'instead', 'piss', 'poor', 'thai', 'dish', 'good', 'stretch', 'imaginationth', 'side', 'dish', 'like', 'appet', 'respect', 'amaz', 'dynasti', 'fri', 'rice', 'tast', 'lot', 'like', 'fri', 'rice', 'youd', 'order', 'surpris', 'disappoint', 'woke', 'mushroom', 'well', 'cook', 'light', 'sauc', 'much', 'better', 'entre', 'even', 'though', 'side', 'dish', 'woke', 'asparagu', 'flavor', 'mushroom', 'tast', 'suspici', 'similar', 'chicken', 'asparagu', 'perhap', 'lack', 'dollop', 'black', 'bean', 'pasteso', 'go', 'go', 'ambianc', 'patio', 'nice', 'mill', 'avenu', 'peopl', 'watch', 'seclud', 'enough', 'enjoy', 'meal', 'littl', 'privaci', 'servic', 'attent', 'quick', 'refil', 'glass', 'compli', 'request', 'even', 'larg', 'group', 'peopl', 'least', 'guy', 'deserv', 'high', 'tip', 'gener', 'prici', 'entre', 'bad', 'food', 'damn', 'gener', 'definit', 'worth', 'dollar', 'price', 'tag', 'per', 'entre', 'mayb', 'happi', 'hour', 'best', 'option', 'attend', 'place', 'cheap', 'three', 'dollar', 'appet', 'drink', 'special', 'without', 'unnecessari', 'disappoint', 'crappi', 'food', 'mayb', 'ill', 'give', 'whirl', 'futureif', 'your', 'wrangl', 'dinner', 'go', 'cantones', 'noodl', 'crispi', 'spinach', 'woke', 'veggi', 'best', 'stuff', 'menu', 'risk', 'order', 'someth', 'els', 'mayb', 'went', 'nightbut', 'doubt', 'sinc', 'corpor', 'chain', 'countri']

1. Cash only for cheap, stiff drinks.
2. Pool tables (or alternately, shuffle board. darts must be combined with some other lure in order to count.)
3. Jukebox (classic rock required, the top 40 laughed out of the place.)
4. An air of disrepair (rips in the booth upholstery, musty smell of smoke on the air- because despite the ban, it's already been cured into the wood.)

This place has all those things in spades.

I hardly ever end up at the Time Out Lounge because I never carry cash, but the drinks are deliciously strong and don't strip your wallet of its greenery too quick. There's an ATM there too. The pitchers and half pitchers are also pretty cheap, but if you're drinking by yourself, you're required to get the half pitcher. Apparently they can't serve you a drink the size of your head in one sitting. What wacky laws.

There are several pool tables that take up the majority of the space, but if you're going during the rush, good luck securing one of them. I'm not that great at pool, but I really enjoy playing at this place (usually with a good partner I can coast off of and then gloat with after we win) because of the atmosphere. So don't be a hater. 

There's a dart board off to the side of the place in a raised area with a couch and a jukebox. My friend and I got our asses handed to us on a plate by a couple of British expatriates in a game of cricket. But tall dark and handsome can beat me any day. It's all about the accent. Surprisingly, I've never used the jukebox.

Translation: Let's split the sweet tea, a pile of fried chicken, some waffles, the fried okra, cheesy eggs with onions, a bowl of mac n' cheese and a slice of red velvet cake to go. 

Brimstone was on the air, a haunting violin dirge could be heard wafting through my head, and a sinking feeling settled at the bottom of my gut. We just made a deal with the devil and we didn't even know it. 

That or I was just too hungry to function properly.

But I do know that I would do terrible, devious things in the name of these chicken and waffles. Pawnshops would know me by name and assume I had a hard drug problem, but my only addiction would be the sweet fried perfection of Lolo's Chicken and Waffles!

Perfectly spiced, crisp but not overly battered, moist fried chicken that even Colonel Sanders would sell his soul for, provided he hasn't already done so in his quest for chicken dominance. 

Crunchy, buttery waffles with a hint of sweetness that are good on their own or smothered in warm maple syrup, that totally wipe the floor with those perpetratin' Waffle House hockey pucks.

Creamy, cheesy, smooth and decadent mac and cheese. A tribute to the best of Granny's kitchen and an affirmation that Kraft should be drawn and quartered for their powdered cheese monstrosity.

And sweet tea that quenches the thirst and makes your teeth hurt its so effing good! Or red Kool-aid, lemonade, fountain drinks, or regular unsweetened tea for you nonbelievers out there.

Almost everything at Lolo's is done well, except for their red velvet cake. It's dense and moist but the devil's food taste (it's chocolate cake with about three bottles of red food coloring in it for those of you that think red is the flavor) is weak and the cream cheese frosting was so thin that there wasn't nearly enough to lubricate the bland, meaty red slice. It was a disappointment. 

But on the bright side, maybe this is confirmation that we didn't make a deal with the devil, cuz his cake was weak."	7	11	10	['one', 'deliri', 'food', 'coma', 'heavi', 'dollop', 'cholesterol', 'two', 'thick', 'slice', 'satur', 'fat', 'mild', 'case', 'diabet', 'shock', 'go', 'pleasetransl', 'let', 'split', 'sweet', 'tea', 'pile', 'fri', 'chicken', 'waffl', 'fri', 'okra', 'cheesi', 'egg', 'onion', 'bowl', 'mac', 'n', 'chees', 'slice', 'red', 'velvet', 'cake', 'go', 'brimston', 'air', 'haunt', 'violin', 'dirg', 'could', 'heard', 'waft', 'head', 'sink', 'feel', 'settl', 'bottom', 'gut', 'made', 'deal', 'devil', 'didnt', 'even', 'know', 'hungri', 'function', 'properlybut', 'know', 'would', 'terribl', 'deviou', 'thing', 'name', 'chicken', 'waffl', 'pawnshop', 'would', 'know', 'name', 'assum', 'hard', 'drug', 'problem', 'addict', 'would', 'sweet', 'fri', 'perfect', 'lolo', 'chicken', 'wafflesperfectli', 'spice', 'crisp', 'overli', 'batter', 'moist', 'fri', 'chicken', 'even', 'colonel', 'sander', 'would', 'sell', 'soul', 'provid', 'hasnt', 'alreadi', 'done', 'quest', 'chicken', 'domin', 'crunchi', 'butteri', 'waffl', 'hint', 'sweet', 'good', 'smother', 'warm', 'mapl', 'syrup', 'total', 'wipe', 'floor', 'perpetratin', 'waffl', 'hous', 'hockey', 'puckscreami', 'cheesi', 'smooth', 'decad', 'mac', 'chees', 'tribut', 'best', 'granni', 'kitchen', 'affirm', 'kraft', 'drawn', 'quarter', 'powder', 'chees', 'monstrosityand', 'sweet', 'tea', 'quench', 'thirst', 'make', 'teeth', 'hurt', 'ef', 'good', 'red', 'koolaid', 'lemonad', 'fountain', 'drink', 'regular', 'unsweeten', 'tea', 'nonbeliev', 'therealmost', 'everyth', 'lolo', 'done', 'well', 'except', 'red', 'velvet', 'cake', 'dens', 'moist', 'devil', 'food', 'tast', 'chocol', 'cake', 'three', 'bottl', 'red', 'food', 'color', 'think', 'red', 'flavor', 'weak', 'cream', 'chees', 'frost', 'thin', 'wasnt', 'nearli', 'enough', 'lubric', 'bland', 'meati', 'red', 'slice', 'disappoint', 'bright', 'side', 'mayb', 'confirm', 'didnt', 'make', 'deal', 'devil', 'cuz', 'cake', 'weak']

Seriously.

Three of these things will have you giggling, slurring declarations of love to the members of your party, believing your sexiness status just gained +2, craving Jack in the Box tacos and possibly breaking a heel upon your exit.

They are a thing of beauty. (And the reason why they enforce a three margarita limit.)

Unfortunately, they'll run you 6 to 9 bucks depending on how much razzle dazzle you're going for. The Sixth Street Margarita is the most basic, frozen or on the rocks, and is delicious. So is the Z Top Shelf, and the Chambord, and the Frozen Watermelon, and the Grand Marnier, and I think you're sensing the trend here.

And the food... Well, it exists so you don't leave in the condition discussed above. It's not as good as the margaritas, but once you have a couple, you're really not going to care that much.

Brunch is the best time to hit this place up and indulge in a three dollar mimosa, their three dollar top shelf do-it-yourself bloody mary bar (with all the fixins, including beef jerky stir sticks!), or the epic margaritas. The chicken and potato hash is decent, but it used to be much better back when it was the savory sage chicken and potato hash and had, how do you say, actual flavor. Now it's just blah by comparison. Well done blah. But blah all the same (although Mr. Man loves it). So you may want to hit up the smothered burrito or jerk chicken salad instead, both of which are delicious. 

Happy hour is also a pretty good deal, with one dollar off all drinks and half price appetizers. I'd recommend the Cast Iron Skillet Dumplings that are like crispy round Asian pot stickers that come out sizzlin' in sweet chile sauce or the Tortilla Soup, which is done really, really well here with avocado and lots of chunky chicken. 

But forget the food. It's the backup vocals to the wailing showboat sex symbol of a lead singer that runs back stage for a mid show sex\/drug\/booze binge while his second tier stand-in entertains the crowd with a limp solo. 

The margaritas are bad ass and they know it. Let 'em get a little saucy with ya.

Drunken frat boys playing alpha male and sorority girls doing their slutty exhibitionist thing just hit a sour note. However in the off hours of college binge drinking, say Saturday day drinking or summer and winter break, I really enjoy me some Mill Avenue. One of my favorite places on the strip is Fat Tuesdays.

You see, I have a weakness. And that weakness is slushy drinks. Slush puppies, Mr. Mistys, Icees, and the mother of them all...the pina colada. Which in a nutshell is why I like Fat Tuesdays. It's pure sugar and ice blended into a melange of delicious. Granted, all the red frozen drinks taste the exact same, but the 190 Octane, Pina Colada thing, Blue Raspberry and Mango are delicious flavors that end in big old hangovers if you overindulge. But since they're frozen, it takes much longer to sip one down than a regular mixed drink, saving you money and still messing you up (provided you go the 190 Octane route). 

Make sure to try an Atomic Cherry (or Nuclear Cherry or whatever they're called) for 50 cents while you're there. It's a downright painfully delicious experience. If you go with a group, which is recommended because you have to bring your own posse of fun up to Mill Avenue, splurge for a round of them. Then watch even the manliest macho man agree that those everclear soaked cherries are a painful bitch to confront.

But under all circumstances, don't get the food.

Probably because I grew up in Glendale, which is filled with boring suburbs of cookie cutter homes surrounded by six foot concrete security gates that house dysfunctional 2.5 kiddo families and promote a sense of community as deep as a valley girl's vocabulary.

So any time we visited cutesy pootsy downtown Glendale it was a memorable experience.

I've toured the factory multiple times and regardless of age, childlike glee paints the face of every person in the tour group. You'll be thrilled by chocolate rivers, marshmallow clouds, edible buttercups and small orange creatures with violent green hair and a penchant for bursting into songs that have afterschool special messages tacked onto the end. Well not really, but it's as close to Willy Wonka as you're getting here in the Valley.

Free tours on the half hour and sampling to your heart's content! Try the rectangular green ones. They're mint truffles and arguably the best I've had. Eat it Andes!! But I'm biased. I grew up with Cerreta. I stole their individually wrapped chocolates from the bins at Bashas. I went to high school with their daughter Candy--who's as sweet as her namesake. I'm a die hard fan of these home grown chocolatiers, and there isn't any other place I'd rather go to rekindle a bit of childhood nostalgia.

It's good family fun, a great date idea, or a nice distraction for the babysitters\/aunties\/grandmas out there (cuz you'll want to give the kids back right after they o'd on sugar).

You do get an unlabeled grab bag when you purchase a mixture of chocolates, but just channel the ingenuity of the young. Poke a hole in the bottom of each one with your finger. Viola!

Unfortunately the ingredients reflected the price, they never so much as purchased a sign, and it ended up going out of business in less than a year. 

I can only cross my fingers and hope that the same doesn't go for Dragonfly Vietnamese Kitchen. The original is wicked fantastic and located in Mesa that has been around for a couple years and consistently produces some great pho (tripe and tendon anyone?), papaya salad and noodle dishes I have ever had. And at this new location they've created a sleek, urban eatery that fits right in with the rest of the locations on Mill Avenue, but manages to trump them in every respect. (Price, service, ambiance, and of course, the FOOD.)

Dragonfly just opened a week ago and has a large banner instead of a sign advertising their presence, but judging by the lunch time crowd, word of mouth has really worked for this place. Their lunch time specials are impressive, with offerings of papaya salad, spring bowls, rice plates, several types of pho and Vietnamese sandwiches with soup or ginger vinaigrette dressed greens as a side for a humble...wait for it...$7.50. I'm still baffled at how they can offer such plentiful, healthy, delicious food at such a reasonable price.

The soup of the day was Dungeness crab and asparagus soup, and there was no way I was passing up crab soup for a measly salad. It was such a good decision to go with double soup (pho and soup du jour) because it was peppered broth with HUGE chunks of real crab, asparagus, mushrooms and baby corn that was out of this world! We ordered the spring rolls as well, which were also HUGE with poached pork and shrimp, vermicelli noodles, mint, lettuce, bean sprouts, and cucumbers wrapped in rice paper and served with some of the best spicy peanut sauce I have ever had. The soup and spring rolls would have made a perfectly adequate lunch, but once the pho arrived, I dropped everything for this brothy delight.

It was served in a HUGE (picking up on the trend here?) square bowl with thin slivered beef, vermicelli, and scallions and garnished with bean sprouts, lime wedges, fresh mint, jalapenos, sriracha chili sauce, hoisin sauce and soy sauce. Any combination of these additional ingredients will result in a savory concoction that can help you nurse a cold or open your sinuses, all while warming you to the core. It's fresh, healthy, light and scrumptious! I can see myself eating her very, very often in the future, and straying from my usual order of pho to branch out and try other things on their menu, all of which are still reasonably priced for a Mill Avenue joint (FUCKING SUCK IT BOA!) at 8 to 12 bucks an entree. I would also highly recommend the fresh squeezed limeade, made with sparkling seltzer water instead of still, which was a refreshing spritz of flavor. They also have a full bar, a must for Mill Avenue joint.

The outdoor patio is surrounded by a pretty twisted wrought iron canopy exit at the front of the store and will offer a lovely dining experience since the weather has started to cool down. Inside the restaurant, the color scheme (green, white, plum and black) and ambiance create a fresh, vibrant, urban feel with large bamboo fixtures nested in beds of smooth black rocks. After talking to our server we were also informed that they hope to have a mellow live musical act in the middle of the restaurant in the near future for diners to enjoy. 

The service was also AMAZING! Prompt, friendly, easy on the eyes, and attentive. The food was ready lightening fast (almost too quickly considering our first courses, but I can see how the speed is great for getting people on a lunch break in and out) and the waiter was charming, making sure we got everything we could possibly need at lightening speed. 

I really, really, REALLY hope this place does well because I want to become a regular here. So go check it out and support a local business rather than a shitty chain on Mill Avenue. I can only hope more of these gems continue to pepper this ever increasing stretch of vapid consumerism, so I don't end up feeling like a corporate whore after my meal. Don't want to taint a dining experience this good with whoredom.

*****UPDATE*****
They have happy hour specials now from 3pm to 7pm! Half price appetizers: Tamarind chicken wings, lettuce wraps, crispy shrimp wontons, hoisin glazed spare ribs, and Vietnamese salt 'n pepper calamari! Domestic bottles 2 bucks, Imports for only a buck more, top shelf well drinks for 5 bucks, and house wine for 3 bucks.

Thursday through Saturday they have live jazz on the patio from 7pm to 10pm. Best thing of all? They extend their happy hour appetizer and drink specials to their customers during this time. So you could eat and drink cheaply anytime between 3pm and 10pm Thursday and Friday!

I think it had more to do with the fact that spaghetti given to a kiddo is more likely to end up on them than in them, and tomato sauce hurts when it ends up in your eye. But in twenty-odd years my palate has matured past the realm of bland noodles and into the realm of big girl flavors. I think that's why I was so disappointed by Giuseppe's. 

I ordered the smoked salmon with asparagus pasta, thinking, ""Heck yeah, lox me up and throw away the key!"" Instead, I got the toddler special in disguise, a big pile of noodles drowning in butter, with flakes of salmon and asparagus floating throughout. Ewwie. The noodles were freshly prepared since it was the weekend and were a doughy delight. It's too bad they were marred by such a crap combination. I mean, you can't even toss in some garlic, onions or something vaguely resembling seasoning? Failure, failure, failure.

My boyfriend's pasta carbonara was a thing of beauty. It is very difficult to find real carbonara in the valley. Most places just toss together white sauce and bacon and call it a night. Very few take the time to saute onions, garlic and pancetta, add steaming hot pasta, raw egg and parmesan cheese and toss until it oozes together into drool inducing blob of yum. Amazing good. 

It's just odd that such contradictory dishes are on the same menu. 

We also had the garlic bread, because what better to add to a giant pile of carbs than more bread? It was passable. Very dry and crispy, more like crouton, and topped with a delish garlicky spice infused oil. Four tiny toastettes for four bucks though. Not the greatest deal. 

I shall be back. I'll just stay far, far away from the noodly combos of questionable origin. 

P.S.  To all my winos out there-- corking fee of 4 bucks!"	9	7	6	['kid', 'would', 'eat', 'pile', 'plain', 'noodl', 'butter', 'rest', 'famili', 'mow', 'real', 'italian', 'food', 'think', 'fact', 'spaghetti', 'given', 'kiddo', 'like', 'end', 'tomato', 'sauc', 'hurt', 'end', 'eye', 'twentyodd', 'year', 'palat', 'matur', 'past', 'realm', 'bland', 'noodl', 'realm', 'big', 'girl', 'flavor', 'think', 'that', 'disappoint', 'giusepp', 'order', 'smoke', 'salmon', 'asparagu', 'pasta', 'think', 'heck', 'yeah', 'lox', 'throw', 'away', 'key', 'instead', 'got', 'toddler', 'special', 'disguis', 'big', 'pile', 'noodl', 'drown', 'butter', 'flake', 'salmon', 'asparagu', 'float', 'throughout', 'ewwi', 'noodl', 'freshli', 'prepar', 'sinc', 'weekend', 'doughi', 'delight', 'bad', 'mar', 'crap', 'combin', 'mean', 'cant', 'even', 'toss', 'garlic', 'onion', 'someth', 'vagu', 'resembl', 'season', 'failur', 'failur', 'failuremi', 'boyfriend', 'pasta', 'carbonara', 'thing', 'beauti', 'difficult', 'find', 'real', 'carbonara', 'valley', 'place', 'toss', 'togeth', 'white', 'sauc', 'bacon', 'call', 'night', 'take', 'time', 'saut', 'onion', 'garlic', 'pancetta', 'add', 'steam', 'hot', 'pasta', 'raw', 'egg', 'parmesan', 'chees', 'toss', 'ooz', 'togeth', 'drool', 'induc', 'blob', 'yum', 'amaz', 'good', 'odd', 'contradictori', 'dish', 'menu', 'also', 'garlic', 'bread', 'better', 'add', 'giant', 'pile', 'carb', 'bread', 'passabl', 'dri', 'crispi', 'like', 'crouton', 'top', 'delish', 'garlicki', 'spice', 'infus', 'oil', 'four', 'tini', 'toastett', 'four', 'buck', 'though', 'greatest', 'deal', 'shall', 'back', 'ill', 'stay', 'far', 'far', 'away', 'noodli', 'combo', 'question', 'origin', 'ps', 'wino', 'cork', 'fee', 'buck']

It's really the texture that's more up for debate. Melty gelatinous gummy balls that are sproingy on the teeth is one way to describe it. Black phlegmatic chunks of mucous laden smokers lung is another. It's all about perspective.

I happen to like the gooey little pearls that collect at the bottom of milky green tea, and Eba Cafe is the best place in the valley to indulge. They used to be located just north of ASU and I would pop in before classes, until one day they vanished without a trace. I was adrift without my convenient bubbly study break fare, but as fate would have it, I was stuck in gridlock on Broadway and what should mine eyes behold? A bright red ""Eba"" in a strip mall across from the dairy plant. 

What a sweet reunion it was! Jelly goodness afloat in milky green or black tea with one of thirty-some possible flavors added!
 
The black and green tea are traditional stand-bys, but if you're feeling daring, try the wintermelon tea. It has no sugar added but the natural sugar is so incredibly potent that I couldn't finish a thimble full sample without experiencing the puckered, day-uuum-that's-sweet face. After you've chosen your tea, try to narrow down the flavor additives, red bean is a solid choice but watermelon is my ultimate trump card. Mango, taro and honeydew are also pretty tasty. Then decide if you want some kind of gelatinous goop added to your drink. They have several different types including boba and coffee jellies, which I've heard are great in, well, coffee drinks.

Eba also has some light lunch and munch options if you feel like nibbling. I've had the green curry chicken bowl, which is earthy with a nice spice, but the accompanying rice was a little dried out. If you're just there for a snack, try the brick toast with coconut. Delish! They also serve gelato, but between you and me, it looked kinda nast. Eba should just stick with what it does best, wicked good tea with lovely little snot balls."	7	5	3	['goe', 'mani', 'name', 'boba', 'tea', 'bubbl', 'tea', 'well', 'mayb', 'two', 'name', 'realli', 'textur', 'that', 'debat', 'melti', 'gelatin', 'gummi', 'ball', 'sproingi', 'teeth', 'one', 'way', 'describ', 'black', 'phlegmat', 'chunk', 'mucou', 'laden', 'smoker', 'lung', 'anoth', 'perspectivei', 'happen', 'like', 'gooey', 'littl', 'pearl', 'collect', 'bottom', 'milki', 'green', 'tea', 'eba', 'cafe', 'best', 'place', 'valley', 'indulg', 'use', 'locat', 'north', 'asu', 'would', 'pop', 'class', 'one', 'day', 'vanish', 'without', 'trace', 'adrift', 'without', 'conveni', 'bubbl', 'studi', 'break', 'fare', 'fate', 'would', 'stuck', 'gridlock', 'broadway', 'mine', 'eye', 'behold', 'bright', 'red', 'eba', 'strip', 'mall', 'across', 'dairi', 'plant', 'sweet', 'reunion', 'jelli', 'good', 'afloat', 'milki', 'green', 'black', 'tea', 'one', 'thirtysom', 'possibl', 'flavor', 'ad', 'black', 'green', 'tea', 'tradit', 'standbi', 'your', 'feel', 'dare', 'tri', 'wintermelon', 'tea', 'sugar', 'ad', 'natur', 'sugar', 'incred', 'potent', 'couldnt', 'finish', 'thimbl', 'full', 'sampl', 'without', 'experienc', 'pucker', 'dayuuumthatssweet', 'face', 'youv', 'chosen', 'tea', 'tri', 'narrow', 'flavor', 'addit', 'red', 'bean', 'solid', 'choic', 'watermelon', 'ultim', 'trump', 'card', 'mango', 'taro', 'honeydew', 'also', 'pretti', 'tasti', 'decid', 'want', 'kind', 'gelatin', 'goop', 'ad', 'drink', 'sever', 'differ', 'type', 'includ', 'boba', 'coffe', 'jelli', 'ive', 'heard', 'great', 'well', 'coffe', 'drinkseba', 'also', 'light', 'lunch', 'munch', 'option', 'feel', 'like', 'nibbl', 'ive', 'green', 'curri', 'chicken', 'bowl', 'earthi', 'nice', 'spice', 'accompani', 'rice', 'littl', 'dri', 'your', 'snack', 'tri', 'brick', 'toast', 'coconut', 'delish', 'also', 'serv', 'gelato', 'look', 'kinda', 'nast', 'eba', 'stick', 'best', 'wick', 'good', 'tea', 'love', 'littl', 'snot', 'ball']

Greg would string me up by my toenails and make me repent for my burger sins if he knew I was reviewing his favorite place as just a three star burger joint. But I can't abide paying ten to twelve bucks for a fast food burger, fries and a drink. That's crazy cakes. 

Granted the burger is juicy perfection, grilled to order with as many custom toppings as your hardening arteries can handle. They have two in particular that get me salivating every time: grilled mushrooms and onions. That alone should warrant a fourth star, especially since they don't cost an extra couple bucks a pop like most places. But it's still a six freakin' dollar burger. If they hadn't plastered their walls with newspaper reviews exalting how cheap their eats were, I would probably be a bit more accommodating, but more than ten bucks for a fast foodie burger meal just ain't on.

I do also like that they offer a mini version of their two patty big madre burger, for the wimps like me out there. Regardless, I would recommend keeping the foil around your burger and peeling it away like the burritos from Chipoodle. This will guarantee that all those slippery little grilled mushroom and onion tidbits stay in place, because they're seriously too good to get away. 

The french fries are also in the style that I like, freshly fried up with the bejeezus salted out of them. Ten billion times better than the fresh but somehow still super bland and lifeless matchsticks that In & Out serves. The Cajun style fries are just sprinkled with seasoned salt. A bit of a let down from what I was expecting but a nice change in pace since it's usually curly fries that get the seasoned salt treatment. Also if you're a limey barstard like me you can grab a bottle of malt vinegar from the side counter and use it to drown your fries. So good.

I also dig on the free peanuts. I realize this is a polarizing issue considering the risk of nut allergies out there, but I like it. When I was a kid I used to judge the caliber of an establishment by whether or not I could throw peanut shells on the ground. Sadly, that has changed very little with the years because I still get a kick out of doing it. 

Alright. I've talked myself into it. It's getting an extra star. Damn your scrumptious fare, Five Guys.

The little parking lot in a strip mall off Apache was bustling with activity, so I hoped we would be able to score a table easier than we had tried for a parking spot. I don't like waiting for the first meal of the day. I turn into the reckapotamus from Hell, whose disposition is a combination between that of a pissed off hippopotamus and an icy cold imp from the underworld. 

But there wasn't a soul to be found enjoying a Tasty Kabob...it was a strange Twilight Zone of inactivity. Everyone and their mother was next door at Pita Jungle, but just because there are a lot of people there doesn't mean it's any good, just that they prefer to flock toward mediocrity, like sheep, or lemmings.

Halfway through the meal, I was thinking about flocking too. 

Although the hummus came with olives, chopped tomatoes and herbs, it was a bit bland overall. The pitas were warm and delicious though, and the combination of hummus and flat bread helped keep the reckapotamus banished to the depths. It was a generous portion for two, but I found myself munching on it just to pass the time until our lunches came, not because it was exceptionally well done.

So I wasn't ravenous when my meal arrived, but I was certainly looking forward to some good eats. Alas, the chicken schwarma pita sandwich delivered the same mediocre impression. The chicken was overly dry and not well seasoned, and again, the pita was the star of the dish. 

I didn't have the Persian ice cream this time, but I have in the past. It's fairly cheap and delicious, so if any of you out there are interested in trying a flavor that's certainly not of the 31 at Baskin Robbins, give it a whirl. I'm considering giving this place another star based on the ice cream alone...but I can't bring myself to. So consider it a 3.5 star experience overall.

I'm just glad the prices were reasonable for lunch, six or seven bucks for a sandwich. Otherwise, I might have felt a bit cheated. The ambiance was lacking as well, with generic cafeteria type seating (as stated before), and the service as attentive but awkward since we were the only people in there, so that leaves the food alone to shine.

That's all you need to know about brunch, which is a good thing considering it's pretty bland. We tried the Island Eggs Benedict ($10, with the kielbasa) and the Hula's Hangover Hash ($9). The eggs benedict were done very well, but nothing really sets this dish apart from one you could get anywhere else, even with the atypical meat choices. 

It was the Hawaiian pulled pork hash that was a total bummer on the plate. The hashbrowns were practically black in some places and mushy in others, and the pulled pork was a mass of dry, bland shredded meat. To top it off, the eggs were done over hard with no runny yolk goodness. Suck.

Probably will not return for brunch, but mimosas and tacos may be in my future!

If you're not ordering something hoity toity, the following formula applies: hot grill+eggs+meat+carb= breakfast. My stomach and I are proud to say inform you that J.P. Pancakes has mastered that formula. They even include some variables in the equation that will knock off your socks and spin them around your head.

It's the small, innocuous looking restaurant in a large strip mall, sandwiched between an Italian restaurant and whatever the hell was on the other side. It's not much to look at, but when the food is this good, it really doesn't matter. Just stick with it until your meal comes. And don't let the constant loop of incredibly shitty KYOT style smooth jazz scare you away. They're willing to turn the volume down, because the waitresses think it's pretty much shite as well.

They're known for their pancakes (duh), but I wasn't really in the mood for a sweet breakfast. I will definitely be coming here the next time that urge strikes though. Their oven baked fluffy cakes looked superb and come in apple, blueberry, strawberry, banana, german and german nutty varieties. Wowzer. There were even more regular pancake and Belgian waffle varieties, as well as traditional breakfast combos and omelets with some pretty cool stuff in them, like avocado or feta cheese. 

I opted for the Hong Kong Omelet, with sausage, wild mushrooms, onions, Monterey jack and cheddar cheese. Ohmygod. It was delicious and HUGE. The mushrooms were gigantic, like portabella size, because they were diced into big old pieces and you could hardly discern the shape of them. The bacon was thick and crispy and the sausage was also delicious. Mr. Man got it on the side with his breakfast. Let's just say it looked pretty phallic, more like a bratwurst than a little link sausage. You'll feel slightly dirty taking a succulent bite out this sucker.

Which brings me to the homefries. They are quite possibly some of the best side order potatoes I have ever had with breakfast. Crisp, small little squares seasoned to perfection. They were delicious alone, but perfection when sprinkled with hot sauce. I'm salivating just thinking of them right now. They were that freakin' good.

It's a little on the pricey side ($9.25 for my omelet and homefries, $8.25 for eggs, meat and fries) for breakfast, the ambiance kinda sucks, and it's located in the hell of old people infested Scottsdale suburbs (side note- we got to see some old biddy drive down the wrong part of the road, twice!) but their mastery of the breakfast art is truly something to wonder at. If nothing else, go for that.

But the service is seriously spotty. I've had one good experience out of the five, and the rest suffered from forgotten or wrong wine, plank of bruschetta never arriving because the order wasn't placed, messed up orders, a 45 minute wait for a half empty restaurant.

Drop the beef and toss on some chicken. And make sure to add vegetables. Yes, vegetables. Blasphemy, I know. Give me mushrooms, onions, green peppers, tomatoes. Mmmm. In fact, you could even hold the meat and I would be alright with that. 

The hot sandwiches at Corleone's are a happy medley of these two extremes. For the purists, there's the Philly Original and for us West Coast blasphemers there's everything from Buffalo Chicken to Veggie Subs. The fries are pretty decent (it takes some real effort--or neglect--to fuck up french fries) but the onion rings leave a lot to be desired. 
 
I've tried a couple different hot sandwiches, including the Philly Original, and it's always a greasy, messy event. The majority of the time the juice and grease of the contents melt right through the damn roll, leaving me with a pile of napkins, a mangled sandwich, and a frown on my face. (I really dislike it when my food falls apart. I usually bite of it as hard as I can to try and inflict pain on the offending meal. The food has never acknowledged my attack. It's a pretty irrational tradition.) So if keeping your sandwich in one edible piece is big in your book, I wouldn't recommend this place. 

The actual restaurant is pretty small, with a long bar with stools and several high tables to enjoy your vittles at. It's also a little bit on the hot side since half of the restaurant is the kitchen, and it gets a bit noisy with all the ordering, grilling and chit chat, but it's a really lively atmosphere and they offer delivery or take out if you're in a hurry. They're open really late too, especially on the weekends, in order to cater to the Mill Avenue night life.

On Tuesdays they have a special that's pretty ace. It's a buy one get one deal on any sandwich in the place--of equal or lesser value (just imagine that in small print)--so you and a friend can eat for cheap or you've got one sandwich for dinner and another for lunch the next day.

I know a lot of people that adore this place, but it's just not my thing. Cheese steaks are not the food of gods to me, but if the thought of hot beef and cheese whiz has you gargling saliva like Homer Simpson, you'll probably enjoy it and rate it higher."	6	8	6	['snub', 'nose', 'zealou', 'purist', 'like', 'chees', 'steak', 'bastard', 'hold', 'chees', 'whiz', 'drop', 'beef', 'toss', 'chicken', 'make', 'sure', 'add', 'veget', 'ye', 'veget', 'blasphemi', 'know', 'give', 'mushroom', 'onion', 'green', 'pepper', 'tomato', 'mmmm', 'fact', 'could', 'even', 'hold', 'meat', 'would', 'alright', 'hot', 'sandwich', 'corleon', 'happi', 'medley', 'two', 'extrem', 'purist', 'there', 'philli', 'origin', 'us', 'west', 'coast', 'blasphem', 'there', 'everyth', 'buffalo', 'chicken', 'veggi', 'sub', 'fri', 'pretti', 'decent', 'take', 'real', 'effortor', 'neglectto', 'fuck', 'french', 'fri', 'onion', 'ring', 'leav', 'lot', 'desir', 'ive', 'tri', 'coupl', 'differ', 'hot', 'sandwich', 'includ', 'philli', 'origin', 'alway', 'greasi', 'messi', 'event', 'major', 'time', 'juic', 'greas', 'content', 'melt', 'right', 'damn', 'roll', 'leav', 'pile', 'napkin', 'mangl', 'sandwich', 'frown', 'face', 'realli', 'dislik', 'food', 'fall', 'apart', 'usual', 'bite', 'hard', 'tri', 'inflict', 'pain', 'offend', 'meal', 'food', 'never', 'acknowledg', 'attack', 'pretti', 'irrat', 'tradit', 'keep', 'sandwich', 'one', 'edibl', 'piec', 'big', 'book', 'wouldnt', 'recommend', 'place', 'actual', 'restaur', 'pretti', 'small', 'long', 'bar', 'stool', 'sever', 'high', 'tabl', 'enjoy', 'vittl', 'also', 'littl', 'bit', 'hot', 'side', 'sinc', 'half', 'restaur', 'kitchen', 'get', 'bit', 'noisi', 'order', 'grill', 'chit', 'chat', 'realli', 'live', 'atmospher', 'offer', 'deliveri', 'take', 'your', 'hurri', 'theyr', 'open', 'realli', 'late', 'especi', 'weekend', 'order', 'cater', 'mill', 'avenu', 'night', 'lifeon', 'tuesday', 'special', 'that', 'pretti', 'ace', 'buy', 'one', 'get', 'one', 'deal', 'sandwich', 'placeof', 'equal', 'lesser', 'valu', 'imagin', 'small', 'printso', 'friend', 'eat', 'cheap', 'youv', 'got', 'one', 'sandwich', 'dinner', 'anoth', 'lunch', 'next', 'dayi', 'know', 'lot', 'peopl', 'ador', 'place', 'thing', 'chees', 'steak', 'food', 'god', 'thought', 'hot', 'beef', 'chees', 'whiz', 'gargl', 'saliva', 'like', 'homer', 'simpson', 'youll', 'probabl', 'enjoy', 'rate', 'higher']

(One plopped me out and the other is her BFF that's been around long before I was doing boom-boom and creating crayon masterpieces on the wall.) 

They wanted salads somewhere downtown. And all the places I've never been to but have been wanting to go to for ages were either closed or greens free-- LoLo's (collard don't count), Palatte, Cheuvront, Cibo, My Florist, and so on.

So Moms decided that Coach and Willie's was the perfect luncheon destination.

(Cuz they thought the salads online looked purdy tasty, and they were right. But I shouldn't have ""judged a book by its cover,"" since even McDonald's looks pretty good in commercials.)

So I swing by to pick up my sis and we dash to Coach and Willie's. I thought the name sounded like a bastard love filly to a Pony Express stud. Or maybe some purebred dog name, like Sir Charles McWigglesworth.

Easy to find. Parking was plentiful. Patio was neato. Sunken bar seemed like a novelty. Horseshoe shaped booths were comfy and inviting. Atmosphere was upscaley for a sports bar. Company was vivacious. Waitress was engaging and attentive. Bacon wrapped prawns were succulent and satisfying. My Woodchuck cider was tasting crisp and peary. And I had a big ole smile on my face.

It was salad time. 

Now if a salad costs ten dollars, I expect more than a tasteless expanse of iceburg lettuce. What head chef uses iceburg lettuce any more? With all the varieties of salad greens to chose from, I end up with the tasteless, tacky trailer trash of the field greens world? I'm not saying you gotta get all pretentious with a salad by using micro greens grown in an organic hot house, but for fuck sake, iceburg? Airplanes and cafeterias are the only places I've ever encountered iceburg not in fancy pants wedge salad form, which classes it up some and acknowledges the fact that iceburg is tasteless filler devoid of nutrients of any sort.

Is Coach and Willie's food comparable to airplane fare? Ahem, yes. My salad was anyway. Everyone else seemed to enjoy theirs, despite the offensive iceburg. I just ate the equally tasteless southwestern chicken mass that came on top and picked around the lettuce filler. So while the lunch was fun and the bacon wrapped prawns were rockin', the salad sucked. And since I've only been here once, they get a less than stellar review. (And I'm stating that straight up so nobody gets all persnickety. I've only been once. For lunch. And a crap salad.)

I'm sure it's a fun place for drinks before a game or for a quick lunch with coworkers, but I'm taking a stand against iceburg lettuce. It should be eliminated on principle alone. (Aside from its uses as filler; see Navajo tacos and garnish.)

Now I have to admit that at first introduction many years ago I would have rated this place no higher than two stars. The service was spotty (as has been mentioned before) with a couple folks doing quadruple duty as wait staff, busser, host(ess), and cashier. The red sauce was forgettable, the ambiance nearly non-existent and the menu limited. But like a good mold (think high quality blue cheese) Casa Reynoso grew on me. This place is now at the top of my short list of fave lunch spots in Tempe.

The service is a little slow, but come here on the reg and you will be greeted by name and your usual order remembered. The fact that it's a family run joint is the reason why everyone does double time during the lunch rush. The ambiance is a little dated but it's quaint, and the amount of heart this establishment has compared to any other fast food Mexibertos or bland, hot garbage like Macayos is unmatched.

This is Arizona-style Mexican food, make no mistake about it. The Mecca of Mexican food is rooted firmly in Mexico and this place is the Copper State's take on it. Mounds of freshly pressed tortillas and chips made from snowy white peaks of manteca (lard), fresh salsa with the perfect amount of spice, green sauce that will blow your mind and rice an' beans that are good enough to stand on their own.

Best off the cuff remark ever. The place was crawling with little kids from no less than five birthday parties. Sundays and cosmic bowling must act as a beacon to small children. Anyone who knows me understands that there is no love lost between me and little kids. Thankfully, the shrill dog whistle of excitement they make when hopped up on pixie sticks and soda pop was drowned out by the sounds of bowling.

We were meeting a couple people here and wasted the time with four dollar bud bottles as we took in the mind boggling number of wee little munchkins tearing ass across the bowling alley and lobbing six pound balls down lanes with bumpers. Our party arrived and we proceeded to have a wicked amount of fun. 

I don't know how you can possibly go bowling and NOT have fun. Between the shit talking and cheap pitchers, hilarity ensues. They eventually turned the lights on, the little kiddos filed out, and our crass, inappropriate humor was given free reign to shine.

I'm pretty sure everything there cost about four bucks. The beer. The shoe rental. The game. It's not the cheapest way to waste away an afternoon, but it's sure as hell a lot more fun than sitting on some sweltering bar patio or holed up inside watching a movie, with or without the ankle biters."	2	6	5	['heard', 'one', 'greatest', 'line', 'ever', 'mr', 'man', 'last', 'sunday', 'arriv', 'brunswick', 'zone', 'say', 'dramat', 'echo', 'voic', 'maximum', 'appeal', 'allow', 'eye', 'adjust', 'black', 'lit', 'cosmic', 'bowl', 'atmospher', 'flicker', 'disdain', 'cross', 'eye', 'utteredthi', 'place', 'fuck', 'hatcherybest', 'cuff', 'remark', 'ever', 'place', 'crawl', 'littl', 'kid', 'less', 'five', 'birthday', 'parti', 'sunday', 'cosmic', 'bowl', 'must', 'act', 'beacon', 'small', 'children', 'anyon', 'know', 'understand', 'love', 'lost', 'littl', 'kid', 'thank', 'shrill', 'dog', 'whistl', 'excit', 'make', 'hop', 'pixi', 'stick', 'soda', 'pop', 'drown', 'sound', 'bowlingw', 'meet', 'coupl', 'peopl', 'wast', 'time', 'four', 'dollar', 'bud', 'bottl', 'took', 'mind', 'boggl', 'number', 'wee', 'littl', 'munchkin', 'tear', 'ass', 'across', 'bowl', 'alley', 'lob', 'six', 'pound', 'ball', 'lane', 'bumper', 'parti', 'arriv', 'proceed', 'wick', 'amount', 'fun', 'dont', 'know', 'possibl', 'go', 'bowl', 'fun', 'shit', 'talk', 'cheap', 'pitcher', 'hilar', 'ensu', 'eventu', 'turn', 'light', 'littl', 'kiddo', 'file', 'crass', 'inappropri', 'humor', 'given', 'free', 'reign', 'shineim', 'pretti', 'sure', 'everyth', 'cost', 'four', 'buck', 'beer', 'shoe', 'rental', 'game', 'cheapest', 'way', 'wast', 'away', 'afternoon', 'sure', 'hell', 'lot', 'fun', 'sit', 'swelter', 'bar', 'patio', 'hole', 'insid', 'watch', 'movi', 'without', 'ankl', 'biter']

I could taste very little else over the heavy hand with the sodium in the kitchen. None of the mouth watering aromatics that normally characterize Thai were detectable either. Sorry basil, lemongrass, coconut milk and galanga. ""Mixed vegetables"" consisted of bamboo shoots and green beans (very adventurous), and the bamboo shoots were undercooked and mega crunchy. Hot apparently translates to a mild tingle on your tongue, so don't go expecting to sate your Scoville craving. And to top it all off the portions we received were meager for the prices. 

I might have caught them on a bad day, but there's much better Thai to be had in the valley.

Besides, if the Time Out Lounge crowd could even hear me at the other end of the parking lot, they'd probably just assume I was being snarky and ironic. I mean, who the hell frequents a bar named Monkey Pants? Do they have children in tow? Is there a petting zoo on the premises? Because it sounds like a Barney-Raffi-Teletubby-Wiggles sing-a-long title, not a place where adults go to get blotto. 

Oh yeah? Well what's in a name? That which we call cheap fucking drinks by any other name would still get us loaded. And who are you to argue with Shakespeare? He hates your crappy emo poems anyway.

Huh. I guess I didn't know how strongly I felt about Monkey Pants until that verbal vomit just came spewing forth.

As a gesture of goodwill to those of you who I know I'll see at Time Out in the future, and will undoubtedly rib me for my irrational love of a place called Monkey Pants, I will concede the following point: it is most definitely not an evening drinking destination. 

It is an excellent happy hour or weekend day drinking joint though. Discount 2.25 well and 1.75 domestic drafts between 5 and 7 (that only increase by a buck at regular prices)? Hell yes. An unlimited fount of free popcorn good for munching and launching? Check. An entire menu of good bar food if you're looking to absorb some of the alcohol sloshing around? You betcha. One of the best waitresses\/bartenders I have ever had the pleasure of tipping? Thanks for consistently getting me drunk, Krista! 

There's pool, shuffle board, trivia cards, board games, kitschy paintings, a fake fireplace playing on loop, leg lamps, and enough televisions to send you into a pop culture coma with their soft, hypnotizing glow. This is the type of place where I can show up at five and drink straight through to ten or later without even knowing it, and thankfully, without even coming close to breaking the bank. 

I've been around for the ""wacky"" antics that others have brought up as negative (one o'clock shirtless shots, fish races, and thematic discounts--moustache Monday and wig Wednesday, and so on) but hardly anyone participates. And I've never been to Monkey Pants when it's exuded a ""frat bar atmosphere."" Come during happy hour and you're more likely to see the local flavor propped up around the island bar (I dig an island bar) than the kind of people barhopping down the Mill Avenue strip. There's just enough buffer room to keep them at bay.

So if you're comfortable enough to put aside pretension and indulge in a little kitsch, I'm sure I'll be seeing you soon!

And if that doesn't convince you, maybe these six little words will:

Bacon. Wrapped. Deep. Fried. Hot. Dog.

All you Yelpers must be in on some vast conspiracy to chat this place up on days when I'm outside sweating to the sweet sounds of backhoes instead of procrastinating on this site under the soul sucking fluorescent lights of the office.

Well played.

I wish I could say the same about Fate.

My dining partner (who is obviously in on the scheme as well) had heard rave reviews about this place from roommates and friends alike, so we swung by to grab a bite on a Thursday night. He was looking forward to a delectable Pan-Asian experience. I was just looking for something to satisfy my gnawing hunger. 

We didn't have a very hard time finding the place, which seems to be a common complaint, and stumbled upon a cute little converted house with a group of five sipping beers outside as they waited for a table. Since they're on summer hours or something, only one of the two houses was open, and none of the cool outdoor decorations (aside from the wicked Buddah head) were present. Just a tiny little stylized sign that stated, ""Fate."" 

I really hoped that the stars were about to align and the combined fury of the kitchen and wait staff would result in the culmination of its namesake. 

After entering the restaurant and approaching the hostess, I was startled by the number of empty tables in the place and pleased that we'd soon have some saucy, ricey goodness to sate our hunger. Unfortunately, that wasn't so. She made us wait outside, after specifically barring us from remaining indoors, for five minutes. Baffling, but no biggie. Then we were ushered into a tiny room at the front of the establishment that boasted Ikea decor and very little ambiance, so I can't even give it points on that basis, which also seems to be a big seller with reviewers. We also sat about a foot and a half from the table next to us and I had to listen to the most pretentious and vapid conversation I've been a party to in recent memory. Not good.

The waitress was very friendly and attentive, and we placed our order for a couple iced teas and the pot sticker appetizer. When it came time for us to order, she was great help with the menu and we decided on the Cantonese Black Dragon Beef and the Szechuan chicken. 

After paying four bucks for a bottle of Republic of Tea, which is by no means 'gourmet,' I was a little miffed but willing to ride out the experience and judge by food alone. Then the potstickers came on a bamboo platter and I felt those stars starting to drift into alignment. I raised one to my lips after dipping it into the sauce and the celestial bodies whizzed right by each other with no care for fulfilling their fate.

They were comparable to frozen Costco brand potstickers and the sauce they came with was heavy on soy sauce and light on any other flavor. I was too hungry to care so I scarfed my fair share, but my dining partner was completely turned off. Still, I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, maybe it was an off night in the kitchen. Then the food arrived with a little side of rice. 

It tasted a little better than your mom and pop corner shop Chinese, but it was on par with anything at P.F. Chang's. And if I can compare it to a nationwide chain, it doesn't deserve any more than a mediocre rating. My food was the perfect serving size, with just the right amount of rice, but the sauce was drastically different than any other szechuan dish I've ever had and the some of the chicken was diced into itsy bitsy little pieces that funked with the texture. I was really hungry, so I wasn't that critical, but my dining partner ate about three bites of his and declared, ""I'm never coming back here again."" To put it simply, he thought it sucked. Hard.

Fate is a restaurant that seems to cater to individuals that place ambiance very highly in their dining experience. The food isn't great nor is it well priced, but I may have gone on an off night, so I'm willing to give it another shot and possibly adjust my review. I'll just have to find someone else to enjoy it with."	5	5	6	['although', 'didnt', 'know', 'ive', 'live', 'rock', 'must', 'age', 'never', 'heard', 'anyth', 'fate', 'yelper', 'must', 'vast', 'conspiraci', 'chat', 'place', 'day', 'im', 'outsid', 'sweat', 'sweet', 'sound', 'backho', 'instead', 'procrastin', 'site', 'soul', 'suck', 'fluoresc', 'light', 'officewel', 'playedi', 'wish', 'could', 'say', 'fatemi', 'dine', 'partner', 'obvious', 'scheme', 'well', 'heard', 'rave', 'review', 'place', 'roommat', 'friend', 'alik', 'swung', 'grab', 'bite', 'thursday', 'night', 'look', 'forward', 'delect', 'panasian', 'experi', 'look', 'someth', 'satisfi', 'gnaw', 'hunger', 'didnt', 'hard', 'time', 'find', 'place', 'seem', 'common', 'complaint', 'stumbl', 'upon', 'cute', 'littl', 'convert', 'hous', 'group', 'five', 'sip', 'beer', 'outsid', 'wait', 'tabl', 'sinc', 'theyr', 'summer', 'hour', 'someth', 'one', 'two', 'hous', 'open', 'none', 'cool', 'outdoor', 'decor', 'asid', 'wick', 'buddah', 'head', 'present', 'tini', 'littl', 'styliz', 'sign', 'state', 'fate', 'realli', 'hope', 'star', 'align', 'combin', 'furi', 'kitchen', 'wait', 'staff', 'would', 'result', 'culmin', 'namesak', 'enter', 'restaur', 'approach', 'hostess', 'startl', 'number', 'empti', 'tabl', 'place', 'pleas', 'wed', 'soon', 'sauci', 'ricey', 'good', 'sate', 'hunger', 'unfortun', 'wasnt', 'made', 'us', 'wait', 'outsid', 'specif', 'bar', 'us', 'remain', 'indoor', 'five', 'minut', 'baffl', 'biggi', 'usher', 'tini', 'room', 'front', 'establish', 'boast', 'ikea', 'decor', 'littl', 'ambianc', 'cant', 'even', 'give', 'point', 'basi', 'also', 'seem', 'big', 'seller', 'review', 'also', 'sat', 'foot', 'half', 'tabl', 'next', 'us', 'listen', 'pretenti', 'vapid', 'convers', 'ive', 'parti', 'recent', 'memori', 'goodth', 'waitress', 'friendli', 'attent', 'place', 'order', 'coupl', 'ice', 'tea', 'pot', 'sticker', 'appet', 'came', 'time', 'us', 'order', 'great', 'help', 'menu', 'decid', 'cantones', 'black', 'dragon', 'beef', 'szechuan', 'chicken', 'pay', 'four', 'buck', 'bottl', 'republ', 'tea', 'mean', 'gourmet', 'littl', 'mif', 'will', 'ride', 'experi', 'judg', 'food', 'alon', 'potstick', 'came', 'bamboo', 'platter', 'felt', 'star', 'start', 'drift', 'align', 'rais', 'one', 'lip', 'dip', 'sauc', 'celesti', 'bodi', 'whizz', 'right', 'care', 'fulfil', 'fatethey', 'compar', 'frozen', 'costco', 'brand', 'potstick', 'sauc', 'came', 'heavi', 'soy', 'sauc', 'light', 'flavor', 'hungri', 'care', 'scarf', 'fair', 'share', 'dine', 'partner', 'complet', 'turn', 'still', 'im', 'will', 'give', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'mayb', 'night', 'kitchen', 'food', 'arriv', 'littl', 'side', 'rice', 'tast', 'littl', 'better', 'mom', 'pop', 'corner', 'shop', 'chines', 'par', 'anyth', 'pf', 'chang', 'compar', 'nationwid', 'chain', 'doesnt', 'deserv', 'mediocr', 'rate', 'food', 'perfect', 'serv', 'size', 'right', 'amount', 'rice', 'sauc', 'drastic', 'differ', 'szechuan', 'dish', 'ive', 'ever', 'chicken', 'dice', 'itsi', 'bitsi', 'littl', 'piec', 'funk', 'textur', 'realli', 'hungri', 'wasnt', 'critic', 'dine', 'partner', 'ate', 'three', 'bite', 'declar', 'im', 'never', 'come', 'back', 'put', 'simpli', 'thought', 'suck', 'hardfat', 'restaur', 'seem', 'cater', 'individu', 'place', 'ambianc', 'highli', 'dine', 'experi', 'food', 'isnt', 'great', 'well', 'price', 'may', 'gone', 'night', 'im', 'will', 'give', 'anoth', 'shot', 'possibl', 'adjust', 'review', 'ill', 'find', 'someon', 'els', 'enjoy']

We were referred to this office by a friend when she found out my husband had colon issues. He is extremely sick and in need of the Dr. He set up an appt almost 2 weeks out. In that time he was not told he needed all his medical records sent over to the office. Even on the day of the appointment they still did not mention the medical records not being received. We waited in the waiting room for 35 minutes. Once called back the girl who worked there told us that the Dr. would not see us because he hasnt seen his medical records and that when my husband made the appointment the person who took notes did not mention that he has any prior or current issues. 
Are you kidding me? My husband totally loves going to a GI Dr. for fun. so they said they put in the request. This was on a Thursday. Friday afternoon 10 minutes to 5 I get ""we only have half the records, but the Dr. still wont see you."" Monday comes and my husband calls again. Nope still no records. He went to the hospital directly and got everything that was need. He brought them back to the office only to be told the Dr. will review them. Tuesday comes and my husband calls only to be told ""something is missing and the Dr. still wont look at the records unless complete."" At this point we know we are still getting the run around. So today is Wednesday. I call and for the first 10 calls the answering service was answering. I was told to keep calling maybe someone will answer. So finally I got an answer. I asked has the Dr. reviewed the records. I was put on hold. The office person then comes back and said the nurse was in with a patient and would call me back. I said no ill wait. 2 minutes later they came on the phone and said ""The Dr. wont see you. He said you need to go back to the Dr. that did your testing a year and a half ago.""
Are you kidding ME!!!!! After all the run around only to be told nope. That was a week's worth of wasting my time. 
The staff there doesnt know what the hell they are doing. They are rude and could give 2 shits about the patient. The Dr. who we never even got a change to speak to is probably in it for the money. At least thats the impression I got from his nice big silver BMW sitting in Dr. Haikal parking only. 
I wouldn't tell my worst enemy to go to this office. 
Word of advice, look for another Dr. One that has a staff that ties their own shoes."	1	1	0	['could', 'give', 'offic', 'star', 'would', 'refer', 'offic', 'friend', 'found', 'husband', 'colon', 'issu', 'extrem', 'sick', 'need', 'dr', 'set', 'appt', 'almost', 'week', 'time', 'told', 'need', 'medic', 'record', 'sent', 'offic', 'even', 'day', 'appoint', 'still', 'mention', 'medic', 'record', 'receiv', 'wait', 'wait', 'room', 'minut', 'call', 'back', 'girl', 'work', 'told', 'us', 'dr', 'would', 'see', 'us', 'hasnt', 'seen', 'medic', 'record', 'husband', 'made', 'appoint', 'person', 'took', 'note', 'mention', 'prior', 'current', 'issu', 'kid', 'husband', 'total', 'love', 'go', 'gi', 'dr', 'fun', 'said', 'put', 'request', 'thursday', 'friday', 'afternoon', 'minut', 'get', 'half', 'record', 'dr', 'still', 'wont', 'see', 'monday', 'come', 'husband', 'call', 'nope', 'still', 'record', 'went', 'hospit', 'directli', 'got', 'everyth', 'need', 'brought', 'back', 'offic', 'told', 'dr', 'review', 'tuesday', 'come', 'husband', 'call', 'told', 'someth', 'miss', 'dr', 'still', 'wont', 'look', 'record', 'unless', 'complet', 'point', 'know', 'still', 'get', 'run', 'around', 'today', 'wednesday', 'call', 'first', 'call', 'answer', 'servic', 'answer', 'told', 'keep', 'call', 'mayb', 'someon', 'answer', 'final', 'got', 'answer', 'ask', 'dr', 'review', 'record', 'put', 'hold', 'offic', 'person', 'come', 'back', 'said', 'nurs', 'patient', 'would', 'call', 'back', 'said', 'ill', 'wait', 'minut', 'later', 'came', 'phone', 'said', 'dr', 'wont', 'see', 'said', 'need', 'go', 'back', 'dr', 'test', 'year', 'half', 'agoar', 'kid', 'run', 'around', 'told', 'nope', 'week', 'worth', 'wast', 'time', 'staff', 'doesnt', 'know', 'hell', 'rude', 'could', 'give', 'shit', 'patient', 'dr', 'never', 'even', 'got', 'chang', 'speak', 'probabl', 'money', 'least', 'that', 'impress', 'got', 'nice', 'big', 'silver', 'bmw', 'sit', 'dr', 'haikal', 'park', 'wouldnt', 'tell', 'worst', 'enemi', 'go', 'offic', 'word', 'advic', 'look', 'anoth', 'dr', 'one', 'staff', 'tie', 'shoe']

I used to go there all the time in the first year or so it was opened, but since then their standards for the serving staff have seriously gone down hill.

I'm a pretty patient person when it comes to servers, but the last few times I've gone, I've had to track someone down to get service at our bay.

Let's just take last night for example:
My friends and I were for more than 15 minutes before someone finally came to the table to just say hello and take drink orders. Luckily, in that time we'd decided on food, otherwise who knows how long it would have been before we could have ordered.
We had eaten most of our food and had a refill of chips on the way (thanks to a food runner) before our server brought out my friend's drink.
She'd forgotten it was at the bar, and instead of having a new one made, she'd brought the drink to the table with almost all the ice melted. We had to track her down again so we could ask to get a new one made.
We saw food runners and bussers more than twice the number of times we saw our actual server the whole night and the place was not busy at all.

On top of the less than stellar service, the food is overpriced for what you get. While yes, some of it is excellent and the concepts are interesting, most is mediocre at best.

Recommendation:
If you do go there, choose earlier in the day when you'll spend less on game play. The savings at that time might at least be worth what you pay for overall experience."	0	0	1	['game', 'play', 'fun', 'im', 'sure', 'level', 'servic', 'worth', 'pricei', 'use', 'go', 'time', 'first', 'year', 'open', 'sinc', 'standard', 'serv', 'staff', 'serious', 'gone', 'hillim', 'pretti', 'patient', 'person', 'come', 'server', 'last', 'time', 'ive', 'gone', 'ive', 'track', 'someon', 'get', 'servic', 'baylet', 'take', 'last', 'night', 'examplemi', 'friend', 'minut', 'someon', 'final', 'came', 'tabl', 'say', 'hello', 'take', 'drink', 'order', 'luckili', 'time', 'wed', 'decid', 'food', 'otherwis', 'know', 'long', 'would', 'could', 'orderedw', 'eaten', 'food', 'refil', 'chip', 'way', 'thank', 'food', 'runner', 'server', 'brought', 'friend', 'drinksh', 'forgotten', 'bar', 'instead', 'new', 'one', 'made', 'shed', 'brought', 'drink', 'tabl', 'almost', 'ice', 'melt', 'track', 'could', 'ask', 'get', 'new', 'one', 'madew', 'saw', 'food', 'runner', 'busser', 'twice', 'number', 'time', 'saw', 'actual', 'server', 'whole', 'night', 'place', 'busi', 'allon', 'top', 'less', 'stellar', 'servic', 'food', 'overpr', 'get', 'ye', 'excel', 'concept', 'interest', 'mediocr', 'bestrecommendationif', 'go', 'choos', 'earlier', 'day', 'youll', 'spend', 'less', 'game', 'play', 'save', 'time', 'might', 'least', 'worth', 'pay', 'overal', 'experi']

Saw a lot of reviews about this place and I wanted to see and taste for myself. Well the staff are really nice and very courteous. ordered the lunch sampler platter with brisket and ribs my girlfriend ordered the lunch sampler with chicken and ribs. I was not impressed by any means I have had fresh brisket that just melts in your mouth ,but this looked and tasted like re-heated brisket ,looked and tasted dry .Try to mask it by putting sauce on it . I have  had better brisket from Fat Louis  food truck than this. Very disappointing.Was not impressed by the ribs either , barely any meat mostly bone with a spicy kick . I asked my girlfriend about her chicken ,chicken is her thing. She showed it to me and it was still pink and raw ,turned her off right of the bat and she didn't  even touch her ribs.The thing I enjoyed the most was the fries and she enjoyed the soup. If this is the kind of food they are pushing out its is very disappointing. this place is way over-rated, food wise. I expected fresh melt in your mouth brisket , Its a smoke house, and it fell way short of that. The thing this place has going for it is the staff and that's about it. If you think this is good  BBQ, your sadly mistaken, or you don't know or have  NOT experience good BBQ. I'm giving it 2 stars simply cause of the staff. Maybe my expectations were a little to high ??	0	0	0	['realli', 'look', 'forward', 'good', 'brisket', 'one', 'fav', 'saw', 'lot', 'review', 'place', 'want', 'see', 'tast', 'well', 'staff', 'realli', 'nice', 'courteou', 'order', 'lunch', 'sampler', 'platter', 'brisket', 'rib', 'girlfriend', 'order', 'lunch', 'sampler', 'chicken', 'rib', 'impress', 'mean', 'fresh', 'brisket', 'melt', 'mouth', 'look', 'tast', 'like', 'reheat', 'brisket', 'look', 'tast', 'dri', 'tri', 'mask', 'put', 'sauc', 'better', 'brisket', 'fat', 'loui', 'food', 'truck', 'disappointingwa', 'impress', 'rib', 'either', 'bare', 'meat', 'mostli', 'bone', 'spici', 'kick', 'ask', 'girlfriend', 'chicken', 'chicken', 'thing', 'show', 'still', 'pink', 'raw', 'turn', 'right', 'bat', 'didnt', 'even', 'touch', 'ribsth', 'thing', 'enjoy', 'fri', 'enjoy', 'soup', 'kind', 'food', 'push', 'disappoint', 'place', 'way', 'overr', 'food', 'wise', 'expect', 'fresh', 'melt', 'mouth', 'brisket', 'smoke', 'hous', 'fell', 'way', 'short', 'thing', 'place', 'go', 'staff', 'that', 'think', 'good', 'bbq', 'sadli', 'mistaken', 'dont', 'know', 'experi', 'good', 'bbq', 'im', 'give', 'star', 'simpli', 'caus', 'staff', 'mayb', 'expect', 'littl', 'high']

a few months ago I slammed.my truck into a curb. I destroyed the wheel and rim. took the truck to Discount tire to get replacements, which they were able to do. They got a factory rim and a new tire the following day. It could have been same day but the I had miss there delivery from the dealership. 

I took it to get it aligned across the street and they said they did the best they could. They're best was well really bad the stirring wheel if you hold it straight the truck would go straight but if you left go the house whole truck went to the left. 

Discount Tire told me they recommend going to Quality Star down rancho. we brought it to them. Later that day they said it would be bout 500 for a control arm thats cracked. But it's still pulling so they need to work on it. Later that same day they called and said it would be another hundred and something for another part. they were really sorry but they are trying to fix it but they keep find problems.  We went down to pay and see it is was down. when we got there they were test driving it. but told me the bill was now eight hundred and something. I was annoyed but just wanted my truck fixed. however when they were done with the test drive he said it's better but not perfect and ask for more time. we let them keep it a few more days but  when we would call for updates it was just a run around. 
I had a gut feeling something was wrong so we went down and said we just want the truck back. they gave us a speech about how it's a process and we should turn it into insurance because the whole front end on the passenger side needs to be replaced. I said hell no and took my truck home on the way I noticed if you hold the wheel level it now went to the left and it you let go it quick pulled to the right. so I had to fight to keep it straight. I also notice when I got home they banged my drive side door frame so I am missing paint along the door

we called a relative worried bout the truck and not sure where to go or what to do. 
He told me to take it to Arrow Alignment and they would take a look. He sends all his customers there that have issues  with there alignments. 
We made an appointment and took it in this morning. They are pretty far from me. the Mechanic talked to us for a few minutes and asked for some background about the problem. 
he said the give him about an hour. 
I went back to work fearing another big bill. but thankfully that didn't happen. I went down and he said he fixed it. that it was the alignment and also the wheel as it had worn wrong because of how I had been having to drive it. Then the most unexpected thing happened. he didn't charge me a dime and said I had already paid enough and he was sorry it was so much trouble to get fix."	4	2	3	['starta', 'month', 'ago', 'slammedmi', 'truck', 'curb', 'destroy', 'wheel', 'rim', 'took', 'truck', 'discount', 'tire', 'get', 'replac', 'abl', 'got', 'factori', 'rim', 'new', 'tire', 'follow', 'day', 'could', 'day', 'miss', 'deliveri', 'dealership', 'took', 'get', 'align', 'across', 'street', 'said', 'best', 'could', 'theyr', 'best', 'well', 'realli', 'bad', 'stir', 'wheel', 'hold', 'straight', 'truck', 'would', 'go', 'straight', 'left', 'go', 'hous', 'whole', 'truck', 'went', 'left', 'discount', 'tire', 'told', 'recommend', 'go', 'qualiti', 'star', 'rancho', 'brought', 'later', 'day', 'said', 'would', 'bout', 'control', 'arm', 'that', 'crack', 'still', 'pull', 'need', 'work', 'later', 'day', 'call', 'said', 'would', 'anoth', 'hundr', 'someth', 'anoth', 'part', 'realli', 'sorri', 'tri', 'fix', 'keep', 'find', 'problem', 'went', 'pay', 'see', 'got', 'test', 'drive', 'told', 'bill', 'eight', 'hundr', 'someth', 'annoy', 'want', 'truck', 'fix', 'howev', 'done', 'test', 'drive', 'said', 'better', 'perfect', 'ask', 'time', 'let', 'keep', 'day', 'would', 'call', 'updat', 'run', 'around', 'gut', 'feel', 'someth', 'wrong', 'went', 'said', 'want', 'truck', 'back', 'gave', 'us', 'speech', 'process', 'turn', 'insur', 'whole', 'front', 'end', 'passeng', 'side', 'need', 'replac', 'said', 'hell', 'took', 'truck', 'home', 'way', 'notic', 'hold', 'wheel', 'level', 'went', 'left', 'let', 'go', 'quick', 'pull', 'right', 'fight', 'keep', 'straight', 'also', 'notic', 'got', 'home', 'bang', 'drive', 'side', 'door', 'frame', 'miss', 'paint', 'along', 'doorw', 'call', 'rel', 'worri', 'bout', 'truck', 'sure', 'go', 'told', 'take', 'arrow', 'align', 'would', 'take', 'look', 'send', 'custom', 'issu', 'align', 'made', 'appoint', 'took', 'morn', 'pretti', 'far', 'mechan', 'talk', 'us', 'minut', 'ask', 'background', 'problem', 'said', 'give', 'hour', 'went', 'back', 'work', 'fear', 'anoth', 'big', 'bill', 'thank', 'didnt', 'happen', 'went', 'said', 'fix', 'align', 'also', 'wheel', 'worn', 'wrong', 'drive', 'unexpect', 'thing', 'happen', 'didnt', 'charg', 'dime', 'said', 'alreadi', 'paid', 'enough', 'sorri', 'much', 'troubl', 'get', 'fix']

That of course means I need supplys, as my other dog ""Luna"" has her own beds and kennel. While I was walking around an employee who we believe was a supervisor approached us and ask if we needed help. She then went on to explain about this puppy coupon book. It was 19.99 and it gave you a discount on a kennel mat, which she said even though it said Kong mats they could use it for any of them. Then there was a discount on food bowls, she again said any kind. Discount on treats and food. Lastly there were so great discounts on training. Classes, doggie daycare etc. So we're thinking great this will help a lot. 

The kennels were pretty expensive, they have one thats a camping kennel. It's great as the dog gets old as she's a small breed and will me sleeping in it next to my bed. It was 59.99 but the one I purchased for my other dog at another business was 25. 

The bowl selection was okay, they was a lot of glass and plastic ones. I preffer the stainless steel. I found a nice one for a fair price. 

Food is the reason I come here. They have a great selection and hills makes a food Luna loves so we grabbed there puppy food and I though it was a good price at 15.00.

Treats a toys we had no issues finding.

When we went to check out the line was backed up and only one cashier. I thought this was going to become a nightmare quick as the customer at the register was a ""complicated order"". But the cashier noticed the line and got some help. 
This is were out visit went down hill. The lady that came up started ringing us up. Telling us nearly every item we got wasn't covered but the coupons. We tried to explain that we picked items that an employee directed us to. She just said ""well who told you that, what's there name what do the look like."" Lucky enough the supervisor walked by and the cashier didn't bother to ask her what she told us.  So we were just not going to get the coupon book. Then the camping kennel rang up as .01 so the second cashier said they cannot sale it. I told her you have it on the shelf with a price and item I'd number on the shelf that matches the item, what do you mean I cannot buy it. She said they .01 means they don't carry the item anymore and cannot sale it. It means they used to carry it. It's a kong brand that they have a large selection of sizes.

They had one that was a great price and I test drove it and man Jag does know how to make a smooth ride. However, I was trading in a ram truck and the dealership wanted to lowball me on the trade because of the tax credit. It's frustrating to me as I am not a novice to buying cars I have bought and sold 50 plus cars. So I did my research and math before I came here. I knew what the trade value was on my truck, but of course the dealership says they don't use blue book, black book, edmonds or nada which is fine I don't expect full trade value but they came in 5 k less. When I told the sales me what another dealership offered he told me to go there. So I did and bought an Xj from them and sold my truck. 

However, there was an issue with the seat heater. For some reason, it only worked when the car was in park. No worry's I took it to this dealership's service department as it had factory warranty on it and was covered. I explained the problem and left my car. The service rep was very nice and helpful, made me feel very welcomed and valued, unlike the sales person. 

They called me a few days later saying there's no issue with the heater and I can come get it. They said they turned the car on and tested it with a thermometer and it heats up fine. I told them that I know it works with the car is in park, but I don't drive around in park. So I asked them to read the notices that the service rep made when I explained how to recreate the issue and call me when its fixed. 

A week later and they are replacing the heater unit.

Of course the breadsticks are yummy. But the alfredo boat you can add to them makes them even better. What I dont get its, they often will an odd number of breadsticks when theres an even number of poeple at the table. But that isnt to big of a deal.

I used to add a ceasar salad because they were great. However they recently removed them. But wait its okay because you can have ranch on your salad. 

But heres the thing that bugs me. They added a new item, the pepperoni fettuccuni alfredo to the buy one take one. I asked for it the last visit. My server asked what item I would take home. I told him i dont want to take anything home can i just have the one I eat here. He said no. Why would you not do it? Im not asking to reduce the price, hell pick a second item and toss it. But why tell your customer they cannot try a new menu item?
Then to night on another visit this poor server is trying to explain the buy one take one and how its not just 12.99 there are up charges for different items.

a few months ago I slammed.my truck into a curb. I destroyed the wheel and rim. took the truck to Discount tire to get replacements, which they were able to do. They got a factory rim and a new tire the following day. It could have been same day but the I had miss there delivery from the dealership. 

I took it to get it aligned across the street and they said they did the best they could. They're best was well really bad the stirring wheel if you hold it straight the truck would go straight but if you left go the house whole truck went to the left. 

Discount Tire told me they recommend going to Quality Star down rancho. we brought it to them. Later that day they said it would be bout 500 for a control arm thats cracked. But it's still pulling so they need to work on it. Later that same day they called and said it would be another hundred and something for another part. they were really sorry but they are trying to fix it but they keep find problems.  We went down to pay and see it is was down. when we got there they were test driving it. but told me the bill was now eight hundred and something. I was annoyed but just wanted my truck fixed. however when they were done with the test drive he said it's better but not perfect and ask for more time. we let them keep it a few more days but  when we would call for updates it was just a run around. 
I had a gut feeling something was wrong so we went down and said we just want the truck back. they gave us a speech about how it's a process and we should turn it into insurance because the whole front end on the passenger side needs to be replaced. I said hell no and took my truck home on the way I noticed if you hold the wheel level it now went to the left and it you let go it quick pulled to the right. so I had to fight to keep it straight. I also notice when I got home they banged my drive side door frame so I am missing paint along the door

we called a relative worried bout the truck and not sure where to go or what to do. 
He told me to take it to Arrow Alignment and they would take a look. He sends all his customers there that have issues  with there alignments. 
We made an appointment and took it in this morning. They are pretty far from me. the Mechanic talked to us for a few minutes and asked for some background about the problem. 
he said the give him about an hour. 
I went back to work fearing another big bill. but thankfully that didn't happen. I went down and he said he fixed it. that it was the alignment and also the wheel as it had worn wrong because of how I had been having to drive it. Then the most unexpected thing happened. he didn't charge me a dime and said I had already paid enough and he was sorry it was so much trouble to get fix"	6	0	1	['starta', 'month', 'ago', 'slammedmi', 'truck', 'curb', 'destroy', 'wheel', 'rim', 'took', 'truck', 'discount', 'tire', 'get', 'replac', 'abl', 'got', 'factori', 'rim', 'new', 'tire', 'follow', 'day', 'could', 'day', 'miss', 'deliveri', 'dealership', 'took', 'get', 'align', 'across', 'street', 'said', 'best', 'could', 'theyr', 'best', 'well', 'realli', 'bad', 'stir', 'wheel', 'hold', 'straight', 'truck', 'would', 'go', 'straight', 'left', 'go', 'hous', 'whole', 'truck', 'went', 'left', 'discount', 'tire', 'told', 'recommend', 'go', 'qualiti', 'star', 'rancho', 'brought', 'later', 'day', 'said', 'would', 'bout', 'control', 'arm', 'that', 'crack', 'still', 'pull', 'need', 'work', 'later', 'day', 'call', 'said', 'would', 'anoth', 'hundr', 'someth', 'anoth', 'part', 'realli', 'sorri', 'tri', 'fix', 'keep', 'find', 'problem', 'went', 'pay', 'see', 'got', 'test', 'drive', 'told', 'bill', 'eight', 'hundr', 'someth', 'annoy', 'want', 'truck', 'fix', 'howev', 'done', 'test', 'drive', 'said', 'better', 'perfect', 'ask', 'time', 'let', 'keep', 'day', 'would', 'call', 'updat', 'run', 'around', 'gut', 'feel', 'someth', 'wrong', 'went', 'said', 'want', 'truck', 'back', 'gave', 'us', 'speech', 'process', 'turn', 'insur', 'whole', 'front', 'end', 'passeng', 'side', 'need', 'replac', 'said', 'hell', 'took', 'truck', 'home', 'way', 'notic', 'hold', 'wheel', 'level', 'went', 'left', 'let', 'go', 'quick', 'pull', 'right', 'fight', 'keep', 'straight', 'also', 'notic', 'got', 'home', 'bang', 'drive', 'side', 'door', 'frame', 'miss', 'paint', 'along', 'doorw', 'call', 'rel', 'worri', 'bout', 'truck', 'sure', 'go', 'told', 'take', 'arrow', 'align', 'would', 'take', 'look', 'send', 'custom', 'issu', 'align', 'made', 'appoint', 'took', 'morn', 'pretti', 'far', 'mechan', 'talk', 'us', 'minut', 'ask', 'background', 'problem', 'said', 'give', 'hour', 'went', 'back', 'work', 'fear', 'anoth', 'big', 'bill', 'thank', 'didnt', 'happen', 'went', 'said', 'fix', 'align', 'also', 'wheel', 'worn', 'wrong', 'drive', 'unexpect', 'thing', 'happen', 'didnt', 'charg', 'dime', 'said', 'alreadi', 'paid', 'enough', 'sorri', 'much', 'troubl', 'get', 'fix']

The inside was small and quaint... and packed! However, after being told we'd have a 20 minute wait, we only had about 7, which was great because the smell in the place was exquisite and was starting to make my stomach sing. 

The four of us ordered the Lalibela Exclusive with the addition of an order of the Asa Wat, which was fish. I had a glass of Ethiopian honey wine to go with it. It was incredible. I was so glad we added the fish because that was by far my favorite, followed by the spicy beef. The cabbage and potatoes was pretty delicious too, though I didn't really find one thing I didn't care for. It was very flavorful and the injera was the perfect addition. The wine was great also. 

The service was pretty slow, which became an issue with us wanting to hit up sweet republic after and we had to hunt down our check ourselves. It wasn't enough that I wouldn't go back again though. And again. And again."	3	0	3	['yum', 'place', 'hit', 'spot', 'last', 'night', 'dinner', 'plan', 'friend', 'crave', 'someth', 'flavor', 'usual', 'also', 'want', 'go', 'somewher', 'havent', 'scare', 'encount', 'yet', 'anoth', 'lacklust', 'thai', 'restaur', 'decid', 'tri', 'cafe', 'lalibela', 'convinc', 'two', 'friend', 'go', 'us', 'havent', 'ethiopian', 'awhil', 'like', 'experienc', 'insid', 'small', 'quaint', 'pack', 'howev', 'told', 'wed', 'minut', 'wait', 'great', 'smell', 'place', 'exquisit', 'start', 'make', 'stomach', 'sing', 'four', 'us', 'order', 'lalibela', 'exclus', 'addit', 'order', 'asa', 'wat', 'fish', 'glass', 'ethiopian', 'honey', 'wine', 'go', 'incred', 'glad', 'ad', 'fish', 'far', 'favorit', 'follow', 'spici', 'beef', 'cabbag', 'potato', 'pretti', 'delici', 'though', 'didnt', 'realli', 'find', 'one', 'thing', 'didnt', 'care', 'flavor', 'injera', 'perfect', 'addit', 'wine', 'great', 'also', 'servic', 'pretti', 'slow', 'becam', 'issu', 'us', 'want', 'hit', 'sweet', 'republ', 'hunt', 'check', 'wasnt', 'enough', 'wouldnt', 'go', 'back', 'though']

I also can't thank them enough for seeing the potential in the old Taco Cabana (and for keeping their bathroom signs - it's a riot!!).

The place has such a nice vibe to it, and the attention to detail can really be seen in the well designed menu, the space and the staff. The tables are all branded with the circle h logo, which is actually a brand once used on a family farm. Pictures of the family hang on the walls to admire as you wander about the space and there is a lot of room to socialize and enjoy some great barbecue.

I've been waiting ages for this place to open, and upon hearing of their first official day of their soft opening (grand opening coming in a month or so), I was able to convince a few friends to swing in to grab some dinner. While everything on the menu wasn't there, most of it was. Well, aside from the Dr. Pepper cake which I am now dying to try. The menu consists of appetizers, some common, some uncommon, like the grilled cheese sandwich trio I think will be a frequent meal and the gringo nachos. Salads are available as well as sandwiches, platters and huge combo meals that will probably cover a family for a decent price. 

I had the brisket sandwich, and the others in my party had the Memphis Flyer (pulled pork + slaw). The food came quickly in a basket with the typical red and white checkered paper. Mine came with the sauce on the side, which is homemade. While the brisket needed no sauce, it was too good to resist and I loaded it on. The bun never got too soggy and hard to manage and the barbecue was amazing. It was enough for a meal too without feeling too full. 

They are still in the process of opening, and as such all the decorations aren't yet up and the bar is not available quite yet, but this should not keep you from trying it out soon. The patio is gorgeous, the people are great, and it's another great reuse of space by a great local business owner.  Bonus is that it's right off the light rail so you have no excuse to not head there. They will also eventually serve breakfast, which, well, we all know I'm a fan of."	12	5	8	['copper', 'star', 'alway', 'place', 'feel', 'like', 'home', 'owner', 'spare', 'expens', 'make', 'next', 'ventur', 'circl', 'h', 'barbecu', 'feel', 'way', 'also', 'cant', 'thank', 'enough', 'see', 'potenti', 'old', 'taco', 'cabana', 'keep', 'bathroom', 'sign', 'riotth', 'place', 'nice', 'vibe', 'attent', 'detail', 'realli', 'seen', 'well', 'design', 'menu', 'space', 'staff', 'tabl', 'brand', 'circl', 'h', 'logo', 'actual', 'brand', 'use', 'famili', 'farm', 'pictur', 'famili', 'hang', 'wall', 'admir', 'wander', 'space', 'lot', 'room', 'social', 'enjoy', 'great', 'barbecu', 'wait', 'age', 'place', 'open', 'upon', 'hear', 'first', 'offici', 'day', 'soft', 'open', 'grand', 'open', 'come', 'month', 'abl', 'convinc', 'friend', 'swing', 'grab', 'dinner', 'everyth', 'menu', 'wasnt', 'well', 'asid', 'dr', 'pepper', 'cake', 'die', 'tri', 'menu', 'consist', 'appet', 'common', 'uncommon', 'like', 'grill', 'chees', 'sandwich', 'trio', 'think', 'frequent', 'meal', 'gringo', 'nacho', 'salad', 'avail', 'well', 'sandwich', 'platter', 'huge', 'combo', 'meal', 'probabl', 'cover', 'famili', 'decent', 'price', 'brisket', 'sandwich', 'other', 'parti', 'memphi', 'flyer', 'pull', 'pork', 'slaw', 'food', 'came', 'quickli', 'basket', 'typic', 'red', 'white', 'checker', 'paper', 'mine', 'came', 'sauc', 'side', 'homemad', 'brisket', 'need', 'sauc', 'good', 'resist', 'load', 'bun', 'never', 'got', 'soggi', 'hard', 'manag', 'barbecu', 'amaz', 'enough', 'meal', 'without', 'feel', 'full', 'still', 'process', 'open', 'decor', 'arent', 'yet', 'bar', 'avail', 'quit', 'yet', 'keep', 'tri', 'soon', 'patio', 'gorgeou', 'peopl', 'great', 'anoth', 'great', 'reus', 'space', 'great', 'local', 'busi', 'owner', 'bonu', 'right', 'light', 'rail', 'excus', 'head', 'also', 'eventu', 'serv', 'breakfast', 'well', 'know', 'im', 'fan']

See. I don't just like FilmBar for the beverages. That's only a bonus. I love it for the small awesome non chain theater it is. And for the great movies it offers. And for the fact that you don't have to go in to enjoy a movie. You could go in just for the bar.

The staff is super friendly. Gift certificates are available. I believe you get a free movie on your birthday. It's pretty super rad!!

I had never been there before nor remember specifically seeing it while in Phoenix, so from the description we had in a brochure we were expecting something else. I'm not sure I was really upset about it, and I didn't mind the charm once I got there, but I was a little disappointed and I could tell some of my friends were too.

Yes the service is slow and not necessarily the best. However, at least in my opinion, I expected this the minute I walked in and scoped the place out.

I ordered the pear panini and an orange mojito. The pear panini was extremely delicious. There have been a few occasions since where I've thought of trying to imitate it at home. My orange mojito didn't taste very orange but in the end it wasn't worth asking for another one with the speed of service.

I've been at the festival every year since it opened, mostly due to having friends that are performing. And every year, I am crying from laughing so hard and am happy for days to come. That's right people. Need a dose of happiness? Get yourself to some improv.

Some may say that it's not as good as other big festivals and blah blah blah... But if it serves its purpose and makes you laugh while getting a dose of life theater at the same time, how could it be wrong?

Various acts from around the valley (not just Torch Theatre) perform and even some from other cities. This year saw troupes from LA, Chicago, Detroit, and more. There's even a family friendly showcase!!

It's a pretty reasonably priced night of entertainment that everyone should see at least once. And if you're really up for the challenge, I suggest volunteering.

I, however, think it was on purpose. Some way, somehow, it causes instant relaxation. The brightly colored walls combined with the patio furniture really did calm me down and allow us to enjoy a two hour conversation without ever being pushed to leave. Hell, we didn't even get our bill until the wonderful Matt C. asked if we could pay. I've been wanting to get to this place for ages, but just never found the right time or occasion. It happened to be perfect earlier this week for dinner with a friend after I was picked up from the airport. 

The food description Matt C. described is accurate so I'll elaborate on other points. The menu, which we both took pictures of once we saw Goat Curry listed, is small and interesting. It leaves me wanting to come back, and yes, next time, I will be getting the goat curry. I'm sure you are all lining up to come with for my 2nd visit now. 

I had the jerk chicken with rice, plantains, and a side of vegetable (I had two to choose from - steamed eggplant or bok choy). It was very delicious. The rice was slightly dry and not very flavorful, and wasn't my favorite, but it was a nice addition to the jerk chicken, which had some decent spice to it, actually probably a little more than the curry from what I remember. 

The plantains, oh the sweet plantains were PHE NOM IN AL!!!!!! Well worth it.  In addition we had a side of roti for the curry order and it was some delicious bread. Probably the best bread I've had aside form nan. Why do other countries make bread so much better than us? Is it because we all try to swear ourselves off of carbs?

To drink, I had pink ting. I know, not surprising. It was a carbonated pink grapefruit beverage using Jamaican pink grapefruit, bottled in Jamaica, but a product of Canada. That made me giggle, but it was delicious. And, well, the name itself makes it worthy.

Overall, this place was reasonably priced, and allowed us to enjoy our meal slowly, and talk for hours afterwards. The staff is truly genuine. If you're in the area, I'd definitely stop here. 

The food is a 3, but the atmosphere is a 4, and I'm giving A Taste of the Caribbean benefit of the doubt."	5	1	1	['peopl', 'may', 'call', 'place', 'incomplet', 'hand', 'paint', 'signag', 'window', 'use', 'car', 'patio', 'tabl', 'seat', 'insid', 'empti', 'feel', 'howev', 'think', 'purpos', 'way', 'somehow', 'caus', 'instant', 'relax', 'brightli', 'color', 'wall', 'combin', 'patio', 'furnitur', 'realli', 'calm', 'allow', 'us', 'enjoy', 'two', 'hour', 'convers', 'without', 'ever', 'push', 'leav', 'hell', 'didnt', 'even', 'get', 'bill', 'wonder', 'matt', 'c', 'ask', 'could', 'pay', 'ive', 'want', 'get', 'place', 'age', 'never', 'found', 'right', 'time', 'occas', 'happen', 'perfect', 'earlier', 'week', 'dinner', 'friend', 'pick', 'airport', 'food', 'descript', 'matt', 'c', 'describ', 'accur', 'ill', 'elabor', 'point', 'menu', 'took', 'pictur', 'saw', 'goat', 'curri', 'list', 'small', 'interest', 'leav', 'want', 'come', 'back', 'ye', 'next', 'time', 'get', 'goat', 'curri', 'im', 'sure', 'line', 'come', 'nd', 'visit', 'jerk', 'chicken', 'rice', 'plantain', 'side', 'veget', 'two', 'choos', 'steam', 'eggplant', 'bok', 'choy', 'delici', 'rice', 'slightli', 'dri', 'flavor', 'wasnt', 'favorit', 'nice', 'addit', 'jerk', 'chicken', 'decent', 'spice', 'actual', 'probabl', 'littl', 'curri', 'rememb', 'plantain', 'oh', 'sweet', 'plantain', 'phe', 'nom', 'al', 'well', 'worth', 'addit', 'side', 'roti', 'curri', 'order', 'delici', 'bread', 'probabl', 'best', 'bread', 'ive', 'asid', 'form', 'nan', 'countri', 'make', 'bread', 'much', 'better', 'us', 'tri', 'swear', 'carbsto', 'drink', 'pink', 'ting', 'know', 'surpris', 'carbon', 'pink', 'grapefruit', 'beverag', 'use', 'jamaican', 'pink', 'grapefruit', 'bottl', 'jamaica', 'product', 'canada', 'made', 'giggl', 'delici', 'well', 'name', 'make', 'worthyoveral', 'place', 'reason', 'price', 'allow', 'us', 'enjoy', 'meal', 'slowli', 'talk', 'hour', 'afterward', 'staff', 'truli', 'genuin', 'your', 'area', 'id', 'definit', 'stop', 'food', 'atmospher', 'im', 'give', 'tast', 'caribbean', 'benefit', 'doubt']

While we were waiting, we were pestered more times than I felt necessary given it looked like it should be a relaxing experience and it wasn't very crowded. And we weren't just pestered by one person, but by several. I wasn't sure what role any of them played and the whole thing just seemed annoying and disorganized. 

When it came time to look at the menu I was disappointed. I was really hoping for more variety. I've been to plenty of Italian places that serve several dishes that do not contain huge chunks of tomatoes, so I know it can be done. Yet, the menu only contained two items I could enjoy, and for what I paid, I expected it to be better.

Saturday a few friends and I wanted to go somewhere delicious no one had been and one of them suggested Portlands. I had only been there for drinks a couple times, and loved the bar area, so I figured it would be nice to come back and try some dinner.

One thing that amazes me about this area is how there are always so many cars parked along the road, yet no one is ever in any of the establishments (aside from Fair Trade). Luckily there is the slightly hidden parking deck so we were able to find a spot there. We got there right on time for our reservation. It was very empty when we got there yet it took a good 15 minutes to be seated. I can't say the dining service here is very efficient.

However, there are so many things on their menu I want to try that I can see myself coming back a few times. I started off sharing the scallop appetizer with the butternut squash with a friend and it was so good. The butternut squash was PERFECT and the scallops were mouth watering.

My main dish was the pork with the bourbon apple glaze and the au gratin potatoes and vegetables (I feel horrible that I forget the name). It was just the right amount of food and absolutely delicious. The au gratin potatoes were fabulous and the glaze on that pork was to die for. It had huge apple chunks with it too and omg... so delicious. The vegetables were carrots and two spears of asparagus and I have to admit they weren't the best.

At some point I bought myself the best supplies to make myself a morning coffee for the road. And sometime a few days ago, I realized that was a damn waste of money. Because I was only going to end up at Luci's. Luci's is where I can go to get a nice dose of sunshine, both weather wise and people wise. Luci's is where I can go and make up my morning song about hot coffee, and rather than have the staff look at me funny, they freestyle right along with me. Luci's is where the name field on the order sticker doesn't say name, but rather says neighbor. Luci's is where I can get breakfast for breakfast, lunch and dinner. And weekday morning Luci's is nice and calm and quiet, which allows me to start the day at my own pace.	2	1	1	['feel', 'need', 'sing', 'prais', 'luci', 'specif', 'weekday', 'morn', 'crew', 'point', 'bought', 'best', 'suppli', 'make', 'morn', 'coffe', 'road', 'sometim', 'day', 'ago', 'realiz', 'damn', 'wast', 'money', 'go', 'end', 'luci', 'luci', 'go', 'get', 'nice', 'dose', 'sunshin', 'weather', 'wise', 'peopl', 'wise', 'luci', 'go', 'make', 'morn', 'song', 'hot', 'coffe', 'rather', 'staff', 'look', 'funni', 'freestyl', 'right', 'along', 'luci', 'name', 'field', 'order', 'sticker', 'doesnt', 'say', 'name', 'rather', 'say', 'neighbor', 'luci', 'get', 'breakfast', 'breakfast', 'lunch', 'dinner', 'weekday', 'morn', 'luci', 'nice', 'calm', 'quiet', 'allow', 'start', 'day', 'pace']

Ready?

Caffe Boa's brunch is the best in Phoenix. Hands down. I'm also making this claim without having ever been past the patio. If you don't believe me, check out the amazing photos I added.

The patio is so gorgeous and serene you don't even realize you're right down smack dab in the middle of college central. The vines growing along the side and the umbrellas suspended from the roof are simply magnificent. The place settings are beautiful, and listening to the birds tweet as they hop around all while a great breeze blows makes it instantly calming enough to warrant going by yourself, serene enough for talking business, and sexy enough for a date. 

The staff is phenomenal, and our server, Bri, was just the best ever. She helped me through some very tough Sunday morning meal decisions as well as explained all about Caffe Boa and how many of their items on their dinner and new brunch menu are made from scratch, organic, and\/or locally grown. The brunch menu also has only been around a few weeks. I'm glad that I stopped by before word spreads.

I started off with the white sangria, which wasn't sold by the glass until brunch. Additionally, during brunch, the pitchers of sangria are half off. The glass was huge and full of flavor and goodness. It was filled with apples, grapes, oranges, and cherries and was absolutely delightful. After the sangria, I had to try the mimosa, and I was not disappointed. Mimosas, Bellini, and champagne are 8 per glass or 18 bottomless at brunch. And yes, you can mix and match them. It may sound a little pricey, but they would kick the ass of the 2 dollar mimosas many places have. Total weaklings they are compared to this masterpiece.

After going round and round on just what I wanted to order, I settled on the eggs benedict which had prosciutto, poached eggs, and basil hollandaise over an English muffin. On the side was an amazing goat cheese and tomato (though I did without tomato). I added some cracked pepper and unbleached wine rock salt. Decadent. Simply exquisite. I don't typically care for salt and I couldn't help but keep putting a tiny pinch on my meal. 

The service was just the right speed for a brunch, not too fast and not too slow. I don't like to be rushed on a Sunday morning. I was able to enjoy myself and take in the amazing food I was eating as well as enjoy the scenery, which made me believe I really had been transported to a gorgeous countryside when I walked in the door. 

I will gladly come here again for brunch, and despite my typical dislike of pasta, the description Bri gave us, has me craving that as well.

It was decadent down to every last tiny detail and I left completely satisfied from head to toe, like I had been on a romantic getaway or a day at the spa."	6	1	4	['sit', 'prepar', 'tell', 'someth', 'chang', 'life', 'readycaff', 'boa', 'brunch', 'best', 'phoenix', 'hand', 'im', 'also', 'make', 'claim', 'without', 'ever', 'past', 'patio', 'dont', 'believ', 'check', 'amaz', 'photo', 'addedth', 'patio', 'gorgeou', 'seren', 'dont', 'even', 'realiz', 'your', 'right', 'smack', 'dab', 'middl', 'colleg', 'central', 'vine', 'grow', 'along', 'side', 'umbrella', 'suspend', 'roof', 'simpli', 'magnific', 'place', 'set', 'beauti', 'listen', 'bird', 'tweet', 'hop', 'around', 'great', 'breez', 'blow', 'make', 'instantli', 'calm', 'enough', 'warrant', 'go', 'seren', 'enough', 'talk', 'busi', 'sexi', 'enough', 'date', 'staff', 'phenomen', 'server', 'bri', 'best', 'ever', 'help', 'tough', 'sunday', 'morn', 'meal', 'decis', 'well', 'explain', 'caff', 'boa', 'mani', 'item', 'dinner', 'new', 'brunch', 'menu', 'made', 'scratch', 'organ', 'andor', 'local', 'grown', 'brunch', 'menu', 'also', 'around', 'week', 'im', 'glad', 'stop', 'word', 'spreadsi', 'start', 'white', 'sangria', 'wasnt', 'sold', 'glass', 'brunch', 'addit', 'brunch', 'pitcher', 'sangria', 'half', 'glass', 'huge', 'full', 'flavor', 'good', 'fill', 'appl', 'grape', 'orang', 'cherri', 'absolut', 'delight', 'sangria', 'tri', 'mimosa', 'disappoint', 'mimosa', 'bellini', 'champagn', 'per', 'glass', 'bottomless', 'brunch', 'ye', 'mix', 'match', 'may', 'sound', 'littl', 'pricey', 'would', 'kick', 'ass', 'dollar', 'mimosa', 'mani', 'place', 'total', 'weakl', 'compar', 'masterpieceaft', 'go', 'round', 'round', 'want', 'order', 'settl', 'egg', 'benedict', 'prosciutto', 'poach', 'egg', 'basil', 'hollandais', 'english', 'muffin', 'side', 'amaz', 'goat', 'chees', 'tomato', 'though', 'without', 'tomato', 'ad', 'crack', 'pepper', 'unbleach', 'wine', 'rock', 'salt', 'decad', 'simpli', 'exquisit', 'dont', 'typic', 'care', 'salt', 'couldnt', 'help', 'keep', 'put', 'tini', 'pinch', 'meal', 'servic', 'right', 'speed', 'brunch', 'fast', 'slow', 'dont', 'like', 'rush', 'sunday', 'morn', 'abl', 'enjoy', 'take', 'amaz', 'food', 'eat', 'well', 'enjoy', 'sceneri', 'made', 'believ', 'realli', 'transport', 'gorgeou', 'countrysid', 'walk', 'door', 'gladli', 'come', 'brunch', 'despit', 'typic', 'dislik', 'pasta', 'descript', 'bri', 'gave', 'us', 'crave', 'wellit', 'decad', 'everi', 'last', 'tini', 'detail', 'left', 'complet', 'satisfi', 'head', 'toe', 'like', 'romant', 'getaway', 'day', 'spa']

It's pretty hidden and the main sign doesn't have the name of the business but just says coffee I believe. 

The coffee is pretty good. I have come to love the aztec mocha. I also appreciate that the cups are already insulated thus eliminating the need for the crazy cup holder\/warmer thing that doesn't really work at all and keeps falling down.

The atmosphere is fairly plain. I believe they have free wifi, but to me it feels like just another establishment I'd stop in quickly but not be inclined to stay at.

How could I recommend anything else though? It was close to the office, I hadn't been there before, and well, they serve breakfast til 2pm EVERY DAY. There was absolutely nothing disappointing about this experience. 

A large group of us gathered there on Friday and when I arrived we had received a room in the back all to ourselves with a long table. It was absolutely perfect. Our server was a true gem. We had waters on our table when we arrived and he put up with our wishy washyness when it came to our orders. I started off with a mimosa that, despite being pulpy, which I typically don't care for, was absolutely enchanting. It came in a wine glass instead of a champagne glass. More is better :)

As it came time to order I couldn't move past the breakfast menu and thought I had settled on the perfect treat. Then I was told by the server there was an underground breakfast menu that included five different types of eggs benedict. Yes you heard me correctly. I did say five. There was the traditional one, one with avocado, one with portabello, one with crab cakes instead of an english muffin, which a coworker got, and the steak one that I decided to try. 

When our food first started to arrive we were told it was being brought out as its done so it stays hot. We began to worry that we would be eating without everyone but that worry lasted maybe 45 seconds as instantly the rest of the food was brought out. Silence followed for at least the first 10 minutes aside from messages of thanks and grunts of happiness.

The potatoes are as heavenly as everyone says.. you need to have them. I also recommend the eggs benedict with steak instead of canadian bacon. I typically down my breakfast (ask anyone) but I couldn't finish my last eggs benedict. I did manage to have two mimosas though. Yum.

At the end of the meal, the sever brought me out a foil rose which I've attached and still have. Why can't all men be as sweet?

In the end the food is phenomenal, the mimosas are exquisite and larger than the ones elsewhere, service is prompt and extremely friendly.

I thought the first time I came here and only enjoyed coffee that it was spectacular. Then I came back for the crepes. Consider my mind blown.

Not only does the outside have major curb appeal (LOVE the use of color), but you can sit at a coffee bar or outside... or in this whole other room. Come on. With that many seating options, there's something for everyone.

One night I was there, a movie was playing outside. This is the kind of place people can come back to. And the kind of place that Phoenix desperately needs downtown.

The stars reached their highest notch though when I went against my gut instinct and ordered the peanut butter cup crepe. See, I'm a huge fan of the Reese's cup. However, I feel it is nearly impossible to imitate. No one gets that flavor combination right and I end up being sadly disappointed.

Unfortunately you have a meeting on the other end of the valley that goes way past spa closing time. In a desperate rush you are searching yelp, trying to find places that have walk-ins available. After two failed attempts, you are running out of time and losing hope. Then you see it. Fuchsia. And it's all pink. You feel like you've possibly discovered the holy effing grail of spas. 

Then it ends.

While the waxing was done well and the price was reasonable and about the same as what I pay at my regular joint, the staff made it uncomfortable. There was really no place to sit and wait.. well there was, but it was hidden and I wasn't informed of it, while my room was being prepared. The wax started out fantastic with the typical awkward chat.. but then it got weird. 

A huge sales pitch started telling me how I needed all these other services done and made me feel like I would regret it if I didn't. It reminded me of the times I went to the dentist as a child and was told how horrible my teeth were even though they were perfect. I walked out completely weirded out and in a foul mood.

The concept absolutely fascinates me. A pop up that has a revolving menu, but always from a country we are in conflict with.

I was in the area last fall while Kubideh Kitchen (Iranian cuisine) was going strong, and well, this was on my list of must visit places. While I was partially concerned that I had built it up too much in my head that it wouldn't be as good as I had hoped, these fears quickly disappeared. 

It's not fast food, but I appreciate that. My friends and I all ordered our sandwiches and beverages. My beverage was a ginger beer that heeded a spicy hot warning. It hailed from Jamaica (not quite Iran).

That food was good. Let me tell you. We sat there beside it, unable to wait until we drove elsewhere to eat. I loved the research they did into the authenticity and the prices were very reasonable. The wrappers for the sandwiches have facts about the country as well as their relationship with the United States. They are so well designed I took a spare and still have it as a keepsake.

Bonus was that you could technically order vegetarian, though you won't get the full experience. Someone ordered a sandwich with no meat shortly after us, which meant bread and mint pretty much.

I'm gonna be real with you. I am not in love with Pizzeria Bianco, and had I actually had to wait in line, this rating would probably be lower. My group was lucky enough to receive the last table without any wait.

Maybe it was the fact that it's hard to impress me with pizza. Maybe it was a fluke that won't happen again. At least that's what everyone keeps telling me. But honestly, I just wasn't that impressed with the $19 pizza I received. Sadly, the leftovers I took home ended up being tossed because I was afraid to try it again. 

I've been worried about writing this for awhile (it's been sitting here unfinished for nearly a year), but in the end, my opinions haven't changed, and I sit here, still scared to return. If someone dragged me there again, or had a party there or something, I'd probably give it another shot, as I hate to write off any place after a single trip, but I honestly felt just eh about the whole thing.

I love how clean the place is and the packaging and presentation of their items is well done. You can find a lot of items that foodies crave in decent sized portions to either make for yourself or prepackaged items that are also pretty delicious. The prices are decent and the staff is amazingly friendly. I love my weekly trip to Fresh and Easy for some goodies to last me the week.

While I've had one meh dish here, I've had far more awesome ones. I'm sure I don't have to mention that this is indeed one of the best buffalo chicken sandwiches I've ever had, and the same is probably true for most. It's messy. It's spicy. It's hot. It's goodness. The perfect amount of flavor and kick and enough to make you just full enough. 

Oh? You need more proof? The waffle fries are out of this world. Waffle fries are one of my favorites in the fry family and the ones at AZ88 do not disappoint. Not too undercooked. Not burnt. Just right. They'll also help take the edge off the sandwich for those of you that could use that.

I've also really enjoyed the picnic chicken sandwich, which is enough to feet multiple people for a picnic. The sandwich is light and summery and there's lots of yummy fruit on the side. I feel like I should be in one of those hidden valley ranch commercials out on the rolling hills with the trees when I'm eating it.

The service is pretty average but nothing extraordinary. The place is swanky though and the bar is fully stocked.

I'm pretty particular and careful about the care of my car. So much so, that in the past, unless I need it waxed or detailed, I usually washed and vacuumed myself. 

Now, I find myself still sneaking in for a little TLC at Los Olivos though, when I am too lazy to do it myself. The staff is super nice and very helpful with letting you know about what they offer and any specials without being pushy in any way. They even have a punch card and eventually you get a free wash. Pretty dandy eh? 

The waiting area isn't top notch, but it's a car wash people. It does have a small shop with sodas, snacks, gift cards, random misc car items and some chairs to sit and wait. Supposedly there's a shoe shiner, but I'm still waiting for the day we're there at the same time. Additionally, Giant Coffee is just a hop, skip and a jump away, and that's usually where I am while I wait.

I've been a loyal customer for awhile now, and this past weekend, realized it was time to get the interior of the car detailed again. They did a spectacular job which prompted my need to review. I ordered the mini detail which does a full job inside and a wash and buff\/wax outside. The four hours was so worth it. They even offered to give me a ride home if I really needed, but I had prepared. My trusty laptop and I did some coworking over at Giant all afternoon. And when I was called that she was ready to do, I was in no way expecting to see my car look as new as she did over 5 years ago. I'm still in awe. Ever since, I've been showing her off, and it feels like I'm in a brand new car all over again. The paint is shiny and new, the inside was cleaned from top to bottom (even the ceilings) and the detail in the dashboard and console is incredible. I had already decided to never go anywhere else, but now I think I'll be getting it detailed much more often.

You will not be disappointed.

As a child, that's where we always had a membership. A YMCA is where I took swim lessons, where I learned I am not good at indoor soccer, even if it does involve cute jr high boys, and where my dad took me with him to use the real gym for the first time. There's something about YMCAs that make you feel like home, and the Chris-Town YMCA is no different. 

The staff, first and foremost, is very friendly. From my first visit to every one after, they've always been kind and answered any questions I have had, no matter how silly. 

The instructors are the same way. I took my first ever spin class here, and I didn't feel like an idiot when I wasn't sure how the hell to set that bike up. And no one judged me for the sad looks on my face when any gear above 14 was mentioned. Oh. And the bike class was outside that morning. Awesome!! The zumba class on Thursday nights is a great mix of different types of people at all different skill levels. And the studio it's in is gorgeous. 

So speaking of gorgeous, that's what this place is. The colors on the outside and inside within the studio and the entry walls are so bright and colorful. It makes you want to get moving. The studio where zumba and other classes are held is amazing. The bright paint, the new floors and the windows looking outside can't be very old. There is a brand new gym with a basketball court that is phenomenal.  

Standard gym equipment applies, but is very well kept. After a few weeks, I have still yet to see one that is out of order. The gym area is packed with treadmills, ellipticals,standard weight machines and free weights also, and always seems to be packed. That is the one slight downfall. Sometimes you will have to wait if you want to use a treadmill or elliptical. However, I've never had to wait long and come on, pick up a pair of weights or something. Or use the amazing rock climbing treadmill wall thing they have. This YMCA also has the fitlinxx system that lets you keep track of your progress. Way to go!!

The only downfall so far, is that they haven't had an operational membership card machine since before I started. Therefore, I still have yet to get my membership card which makes it not feel as real. I'm sure the minute I come in with the most terrible workout getup known to mankind, it will magically be fixed. I'll try to do that soon."	3	2	1	['decid', 'final', 'get', 'gym', 'membership', 'summer', 'month', 'made', 'run', 'dont', 'care', 'anyon', 'say', 'found', 'hard', 'look', 'anywher', 'ymca', 'child', 'that', 'alway', 'membership', 'ymca', 'took', 'swim', 'lesson', 'learn', 'good', 'indoor', 'soccer', 'even', 'involv', 'cute', 'jr', 'high', 'boy', 'dad', 'took', 'use', 'real', 'gym', 'first', 'time', 'there', 'someth', 'ymca', 'make', 'feel', 'like', 'home', 'christown', 'ymca', 'differ', 'staff', 'first', 'foremost', 'friendli', 'first', 'visit', 'everi', 'one', 'theyv', 'alway', 'kind', 'answer', 'question', 'matter', 'silli', 'instructor', 'way', 'took', 'first', 'ever', 'spin', 'class', 'didnt', 'feel', 'like', 'idiot', 'wasnt', 'sure', 'hell', 'set', 'bike', 'one', 'judg', 'sad', 'look', 'face', 'gear', 'mention', 'oh', 'bike', 'class', 'outsid', 'morn', 'awesom', 'zumba', 'class', 'thursday', 'night', 'great', 'mix', 'differ', 'type', 'peopl', 'differ', 'skill', 'level', 'studio', 'gorgeou', 'speak', 'gorgeou', 'that', 'place', 'color', 'outsid', 'insid', 'within', 'studio', 'entri', 'wall', 'bright', 'color', 'make', 'want', 'get', 'move', 'studio', 'zumba', 'class', 'held', 'amaz', 'bright', 'paint', 'new', 'floor', 'window', 'look', 'outsid', 'cant', 'old', 'brand', 'new', 'gym', 'basketbal', 'court', 'phenomen', 'standard', 'gym', 'equip', 'appli', 'well', 'kept', 'week', 'still', 'yet', 'see', 'one', 'order', 'gym', 'area', 'pack', 'treadmil', 'ellipticalsstandard', 'weight', 'machin', 'free', 'weight', 'also', 'alway', 'seem', 'pack', 'one', 'slight', 'downfal', 'sometim', 'wait', 'want', 'use', 'treadmil', 'ellipt', 'howev', 'ive', 'never', 'wait', 'long', 'come', 'pick', 'pair', 'weight', 'someth', 'use', 'amaz', 'rock', 'climb', 'treadmil', 'wall', 'thing', 'ymca', 'also', 'fitlinxx', 'system', 'let', 'keep', 'track', 'progress', 'way', 'goth', 'downfal', 'far', 'havent', 'oper', 'membership', 'card', 'machin', 'sinc', 'start', 'therefor', 'still', 'yet', 'get', 'membership', 'card', 'make', 'feel', 'real', 'im', 'sure', 'minut', 'come', 'terribl', 'workout', 'getup', 'known', 'mankind', 'magic', 'fix', 'ill', 'tri', 'soon']

The only problem was, everything I thought of, I didn't think I'd want years down the road. I love accessories, but I'm pretty picky about anything permanent. Last year, I finally decided, and had a friend draw up some sketches around my idea. The result was something I couldn't *not* get inked. And when I started asking around, everyone pointed me to Heather at Lady Luck. 

Heather has a quaint little shop in Braggs Pie Factory. Heather has a pink glittery art piece of a unicorn. I was in love with it. She was in love with my tattoo. It was a match made in heaven. 

I worked with Heather for about 4 months before the big day. I showed her my sketch. We discussed the procedure and prices. I had the sketch stenciled on me in at least two different places so I could try out places before the day came. I called her. I emailed her. I asked her a million paranoid questions. I was sure she'd be annoyed with me by the time the day came. 

I went in, and Heather had a TV set up for while I was there and a stand that I could easily set my water and phone on. I brought a few movies of my own and my ipod, but I didn't even use them. We ended up watching one of her movie and laughing and talking about it the whole time. She finished the piece in nearly no time at all, which pretty much takes up the front part of the top of my left arm, but is only in black and white in a little over an hour. And only the bottom of Dot's dress hurt, and even that pain was tolerable. I was surprised. I had completely planned on freaking out and ending up with a toe or something and that's it. Instead, I walked out with the most gorgeous thing I could imagine, an appointment for a tiny touch up a few months later, and great instructions on how to care for it. 

And still I called a few more times, unsure if what I was experiencing was normal. And no one yelled at me or became annoyed (at least to my face). And the touchup was free. 

Here I am about 8 months later, with a tattoo that to this day, gets way too much attention. But hey, that's part of the reason you get one right? Everyone loves Dot.

However, by the time my friends and I got around to eating and stopped chatting, we knew there would be a long line at Los Dos, so we swung by Aunt Chiladas. While it was good, it wasn't fantastic, and I'm not sure I'd do it again.

The first foul was getting there and not realizing the entire front area was a bar\/bar seating and not places you can order food (speaking of which, why can't you order food at the bar... ugh). We were then thrown with a 50 minute wait for what seemed like a practically empty parking lot. As starving as we were, we probably ate way more chips than we should have and started in on a pitcher of sangria. By the way, the sangria had no fruit in it.. I think they removed it before they put it in the pitcher. VERY disappointing. 

After we were finally allowed to leave the cougar area and head to the main establishment, the food was just meh in my opinion. Interestingly enough when our food came, our waitress brought it out and then just walked away leaving it on the fold out serving tray and not delivering it to our table. The tacos a friend ordered were taunting him horrendously. Mine came with the wrong side dish which meant I had to constantly push it out of the way. 

The fried ice cream was good, but not the best I've had.

In the end, this was just a good learning experience...but it was great to be back amongst friends."	3	1	1	['grand', 'return', 'valley', 'crave', 'mexican', 'howev', 'time', 'friend', 'got', 'around', 'eat', 'stop', 'chat', 'knew', 'would', 'long', 'line', 'lo', 'do', 'swung', 'aunt', 'chilada', 'good', 'wasnt', 'fantast', 'im', 'sure', 'id', 'againth', 'first', 'foul', 'get', 'realiz', 'entir', 'front', 'area', 'barbar', 'seat', 'place', 'order', 'food', 'speak', 'cant', 'order', 'food', 'bar', 'ugh', 'thrown', 'minut', 'wait', 'seem', 'like', 'practic', 'empti', 'park', 'lot', 'starv', 'probabl', 'ate', 'way', 'chip', 'start', 'pitcher', 'sangria', 'way', 'sangria', 'fruit', 'think', 'remov', 'put', 'pitcher', 'disappoint', 'final', 'allow', 'leav', 'cougar', 'area', 'head', 'main', 'establish', 'food', 'meh', 'opinion', 'interestingli', 'enough', 'food', 'came', 'waitress', 'brought', 'walk', 'away', 'leav', 'fold', 'serv', 'tray', 'deliv', 'tabl', 'taco', 'friend', 'order', 'taunt', 'horrend', 'mine', 'came', 'wrong', 'side', 'dish', 'meant', 'constantli', 'push', 'way', 'fri', 'ice', 'cream', 'good', 'best', 'ive', 'hadin', 'end', 'good', 'learn', 'experiencebut', 'great', 'back', 'amongst', 'friend']

Not much my friends. Not much. I haven't bowled much in AZ so I wasn't really sure what to expect, and I have to admit, that there were some major differences from when I bowl with my family elsewhere. 

The biggest? The bowling balls were behind the counter. Is this normal in AZ? I understand people seem to love to steal the shoes, but do people really try to steal bowling balls? It totally sucked to have to go to the counter to test out bowling balls between frames to find a good weight.

They kind of made up for this by having PBR on tap, but were brought back down again by not having the ginger in the Jameson & Ginger as advertised. Upon asking, they made a ginger ale (the coke crap) and well I really wanted some so it was acceptable. I remember my quote being, ""This isn't bad for a fake ginger ale & Jameson."" I'm not quite sure if I liked that they came and got my order at the lanes or not. They were pretty insistent on me not heading to the bar to order my drink, even though I had no clue what they had, so I needed to scope it out. If you want to server people, that's fantastic. Really. I'm a fan. But have the menu by the lanes.

All in all the lanes were easy to use and we didn't have too many issues we needed assistance with other than a bowling ball that kept getting stuck in the return. A total of maybe 6 times. In 2 games. Bonus for being able to customize your ""theme."" Anti-bonus for the crappy ads to the left when no one's playing beside you. The only food that looked good on that screen was the chocolate chip cookies. And those guys that are advertising bowling safety, do not look like bowlers. 

We paid for our shoes up front and the games when we finished. It was pretty easy and the rates weren't that bad in my opinion. Sounds like this may become an occasional thing, though in which case, I'll have to up my game.

I guess after my third time there I should probably review.

My wasabi pork dumplings ended up being consumed by one of the other members of my party and my ginger pork salad mostly consumed by me. They were two items I had never had before and I have to admit I was somewhat a happy camper, but not quite what I was expecting them to taste like either. I can say though that was the first time I ever had just an okay food experience at Sens. The sugar cane is fabulous and the miso is some of the best ever. 

They may be small plates, but they are filling and reasonably priced in my opinion. 

The cucumber water? Fantastic and refreshing. If you are craving sake, go for the chilled lemongrass. However, remember it's potent and potentially can be a weapon that ruins your night.

The DJ we had last night as we sat down was truly phenomenal and I wish he would've stayed the entire night. He played the type of music that is appropriate for Sens. Instrumental, mix of upbeat and slow but all with some ambiance. It made you want to strike up a quiet conversation and just take in the atmosphere, which is decadent. After awhile though the DJ switched and the new one was playing a mixture of good songs, but nothing appropriate for Sens. I don't want to hear George Clinton and dog panting as I'm enjoying a cup of Jasmine tea and staring at the beautiful blossom in the pot."	2	2	2	['plan', 'end', 'moira', 'last', 'night', 'hour', 'wait', 'starv', 'friend', 'adjust', 'plan', 'head', 'toward', 'sen', 'minut', 'wait', 'guess', 'third', 'time', 'probabl', 'reviewmi', 'wasabi', 'pork', 'dumpl', 'end', 'consum', 'one', 'member', 'parti', 'ginger', 'pork', 'salad', 'mostli', 'consum', 'two', 'item', 'never', 'admit', 'somewhat', 'happi', 'camper', 'quit', 'expect', 'tast', 'like', 'either', 'say', 'though', 'first', 'time', 'ever', 'okay', 'food', 'experi', 'sen', 'sugar', 'cane', 'fabul', 'miso', 'best', 'ever', 'may', 'small', 'plate', 'fill', 'reason', 'price', 'opinion', 'cucumb', 'water', 'fantast', 'refresh', 'crave', 'sake', 'go', 'chill', 'lemongrass', 'howev', 'rememb', 'potent', 'potenti', 'weapon', 'ruin', 'nightth', 'dj', 'last', 'night', 'sat', 'truli', 'phenomen', 'wish', 'wouldv', 'stay', 'entir', 'night', 'play', 'type', 'music', 'appropri', 'sen', 'instrument', 'mix', 'upbeat', 'slow', 'ambianc', 'made', 'want', 'strike', 'quiet', 'convers', 'take', 'atmospher', 'decad', 'awhil', 'though', 'dj', 'switch', 'new', 'one', 'play', 'mixtur', 'good', 'song', 'noth', 'appropri', 'sen', 'dont', 'want', 'hear', 'georg', 'clinton', 'dog', 'pant', 'im', 'enjoy', 'cup', 'jasmin', 'tea', 'stare', 'beauti', 'blossom', 'pot']

The evening was supposed to start out with a trip to BW3s in Mesa (Buffalo Wild Wings for you non midwesterners). However, due to a special event we had to make a last minute decision to head to Famous Daves. At first we were told there would be an hour wait, which was sad. No more than 5 minutes after we seated ourselves at the bar though, our table was ready!! Success!!

Our server was pretty polite and I appreciated his razzing me for only having water (I had already downed 10 cocktails earlier that day) and was very good with taking our orders and the quirky ways we wanted to change things. Our food came out fast and prompt and everyone seemed very pleased with the change in venue. 

Some things that put them above being a typical barbecue chain?

** At one point someone at the table was telling a story and the pig decided to sit down at the fireplace behind her and imitate her for about 5 minutes before she noticed. It was HILAROUS. You creeped me out at first pig, but I heart you now.

** Dynamite looking sparklers on free birthday treats??? ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL. We were all jealous of that dessert. 

What started off as a tragedy was saved by Famous Daves. I was unable to eat my food that night as I wasn't feeling well, but I can tell you that it's pretty good reheated the next day.

When I first moved to the area, I was having issues finding what I wanted. That was until I found out there was a new development with two level apartments. I fell in love and moved in. 

Alta is a nice community with a greenbelt, pool, community club house, gym, walking paths, playground, community grills and a dog park. There are several different layouts to pick and all of them are two story with a garage. Vaulted ceilings add to their charm. 

Overall I enjoyed living there and the community was gorgeous. Very green grass, gorgeous little courtyard areas between apartments. Several times people would not believe me when I said they were rentals. 

However, over time, it didn't remain in the same condition it was in when I moved. More ASU students and so forth have started moving in and abusing the rules. I like to party as much as the next, but what I don't like is waking up at 6am because someone decided it was appropriate to stop in the middle of the road by my place, start their car and just get out of it and leave it running for a half hour.  I didn't enjoy the people walking their dogs without leashes. To clarify, I love dogs, and I've had dogs running loose in my own yard. But not everyone likes dogs and you may walk past someone who is scared. Your dog may also become spooked for some reason and react. I didn't enjoy people ignoring the no glass in the pool rule, which resulted in the pool having to be emptied, cleaned and refilled.. especially when it was hot out. I also didn't enjoy one pool. The community is built on an old golf course and was way too big for one pool. It has two different addresses and entrances for crying out loud.

Also note there's a mandatory valet trash fee. This is so you don't have to take your trash to the big bin that's probably not too far from your house. 

Maintenance was fairly reliable but I did find myself having to call to find out what happened with a call or double check to make sure someone did make the call on occasion. Moving out was for the most part painless. I cleaned and made sure everything was in pristine condition and turned my keys in and was done with it. 

In the end, it's a nice place. I wouldn't say I couldn't stand it... but it did evolve into something much different than when I first moved in."	6	0	0	['everi', 'apart', 'complex', 'go', 'up', 'down', 'that', 'come', 'rent', 'own', 'first', 'move', 'area', 'issu', 'find', 'want', 'found', 'new', 'develop', 'two', 'level', 'apart', 'fell', 'love', 'move', 'alta', 'nice', 'commun', 'greenbelt', 'pool', 'commun', 'club', 'hous', 'gym', 'walk', 'path', 'playground', 'commun', 'grill', 'dog', 'park', 'sever', 'differ', 'layout', 'pick', 'two', 'stori', 'garag', 'vault', 'ceil', 'add', 'charm', 'overal', 'enjoy', 'live', 'commun', 'gorgeou', 'green', 'grass', 'gorgeou', 'littl', 'courtyard', 'area', 'apart', 'sever', 'time', 'peopl', 'would', 'believ', 'said', 'rental', 'howev', 'time', 'didnt', 'remain', 'condit', 'move', 'asu', 'student', 'forth', 'start', 'move', 'abus', 'rule', 'like', 'parti', 'much', 'next', 'dont', 'like', 'wake', 'someon', 'decid', 'appropri', 'stop', 'middl', 'road', 'place', 'start', 'car', 'get', 'leav', 'run', 'half', 'hour', 'didnt', 'enjoy', 'peopl', 'walk', 'dog', 'without', 'leash', 'clarifi', 'love', 'dog', 'ive', 'dog', 'run', 'loos', 'yard', 'everyon', 'like', 'dog', 'may', 'walk', 'past', 'someon', 'scare', 'dog', 'may', 'also', 'becom', 'spook', 'reason', 'react', 'didnt', 'enjoy', 'peopl', 'ignor', 'glass', 'pool', 'rule', 'result', 'pool', 'empti', 'clean', 'refil', 'especi', 'hot', 'also', 'didnt', 'enjoy', 'one', 'pool', 'commun', 'built', 'old', 'golf', 'cours', 'way', 'big', 'one', 'pool', 'two', 'differ', 'address', 'entranc', 'cri', 'loudalso', 'note', 'there', 'mandatori', 'valet', 'trash', 'fee', 'dont', 'take', 'trash', 'big', 'bin', 'that', 'probabl', 'far', 'hous', 'mainten', 'fairli', 'reliabl', 'find', 'call', 'find', 'happen', 'call', 'doubl', 'check', 'make', 'sure', 'someon', 'make', 'call', 'occas', 'move', 'part', 'painless', 'clean', 'made', 'sure', 'everyth', 'pristin', 'condit', 'turn', 'key', 'done', 'end', 'nice', 'place', 'wouldnt', 'say', 'couldnt', 'stand', 'evolv', 'someth', 'much', 'differ', 'first', 'move']

Delux was one of the first restaurants I went to upon moving to Phoenix and I have gone back a few times since, mainly at lunch during the work week. It's my favorite burger spot. 

The atmosphere is slightly on the pretentious side. However, it's very small and pretty cramped. Even at lunch during the week it can feel cramped at a table and there's a big chance of waiting in line awhile. I've sat both inside and outside and felt a little too close to the other tables. It's a little complicated with bigger groups also.

The food however is amazing. I always get the same thing, a delux burger and sweet potato fries. I don't care if you are scared of medium rare, you need to try this thing. It's one of the most amazing burger's I've had and I can never finish the entire thing. I'd love to have a mini one. That would be perfect. A regular order of fries comes in an adorable metal mini shopping cart. Also good to note is that by default you do not get just ketchup with your fries. Being a non tomato eater, it's nice to not have to remember to ask for another dipping sauce. 

Oh the beer list you ask? Phenomenal. Being able to order a red velvet always makes me happy. Unique beer flights make me happy also. 

I never have room for dessert while I'm there but I did have a friend order the cookies they brag about one time. It was rather hard and I wasn't impressed. That cookie should have been soft and chewy and full of deliciousness.

It's a bit on the pricey side, and you typically are going to have to wait awhile and\/or be cramped, but if you're not in a hurry, it's worth checking out."	1	1	0	['de', 'lish', 'us', 'delux', 'one', 'first', 'restaur', 'went', 'upon', 'move', 'phoenix', 'gone', 'back', 'time', 'sinc', 'mainli', 'lunch', 'work', 'week', 'favorit', 'burger', 'spot', 'atmospher', 'slightli', 'pretenti', 'side', 'howev', 'small', 'pretti', 'cramp', 'even', 'lunch', 'week', 'feel', 'cramp', 'tabl', 'there', 'big', 'chanc', 'wait', 'line', 'awhil', 'ive', 'sat', 'insid', 'outsid', 'felt', 'littl', 'close', 'tabl', 'littl', 'complic', 'bigger', 'group', 'alsoth', 'food', 'howev', 'amaz', 'alway', 'get', 'thing', 'delux', 'burger', 'sweet', 'potato', 'fri', 'dont', 'care', 'scare', 'medium', 'rare', 'need', 'tri', 'thing', 'one', 'amaz', 'burger', 'ive', 'never', 'finish', 'entir', 'thing', 'id', 'love', 'mini', 'one', 'would', 'perfect', 'regular', 'order', 'fri', 'come', 'ador', 'metal', 'mini', 'shop', 'cart', 'also', 'good', 'note', 'default', 'get', 'ketchup', 'fri', 'non', 'tomato', 'eater', 'nice', 'rememb', 'ask', 'anoth', 'dip', 'sauc', 'oh', 'beer', 'list', 'ask', 'phenomen', 'abl', 'order', 'red', 'velvet', 'alway', 'make', 'happi', 'uniqu', 'beer', 'flight', 'make', 'happi', 'also', 'never', 'room', 'dessert', 'im', 'friend', 'order', 'cooki', 'brag', 'one', 'time', 'rather', 'hard', 'wasnt', 'impress', 'cooki', 'soft', 'chewi', 'full', 'deliciousnessit', 'bit', 'pricey', 'side', 'typic', 'go', 'wait', 'awhil', 'andor', 'cramp', 'your', 'hurri', 'worth', 'check']

The statue of liberty, the fountain, the old bicycle.. it's briliant!!

The food is also incredible. I crave the salsa constantly and the sopapillas are a force to be reckoned with. So far I've had the carnitas and the adovada and love it. I like that Los Dos isn't afraid of spice and doesn't wimp out for it's customers. It's authentic Mexican, take it or leave it.

The museum was much larger than I expected and well worth the admission price. The pinball gallery in the entry is fantastic and I found myself singing Pinball Wizard as I walked out at the end of my stay. 

The exhibits were all interesting and I could have stayed there well longer than I had time to if I watched all the video exhibits from start to finish. The way the exhibits were set up made sense and were easy to comprehend and enjoy without a lot of reading tiny chapters of books hung to a wall. Some of the exhibits were also hands on and more of an interaction than a viewing. Balloons in the air, interesting entrance ways and music. They also did a great job of setting up the vibe in each separate area. 

The gift shop didn't have as much Warhol stuff as just goofy stuff you would find in Spencer's. That and the parking situation disappointed me."	1	0	0	['head', 'warhol', 'weekday', 'afternoon', 'busi', 'pittsburgh', 'look', 'get', 'cultur', 'head', 'afternoon', 'flight', 'back', 'home', 'museum', 'much', 'larger', 'expect', 'well', 'worth', 'admiss', 'price', 'pinbal', 'galleri', 'entri', 'fantast', 'found', 'sing', 'pinbal', 'wizard', 'walk', 'end', 'stay', 'exhibit', 'interest', 'could', 'stay', 'well', 'longer', 'time', 'watch', 'video', 'exhibit', 'start', 'finish', 'way', 'exhibit', 'set', 'made', 'sens', 'easi', 'comprehend', 'enjoy', 'without', 'lot', 'read', 'tini', 'chapter', 'book', 'hung', 'wall', 'exhibit', 'also', 'hand', 'interact', 'view', 'balloon', 'air', 'interest', 'entranc', 'way', 'music', 'also', 'great', 'job', 'set', 'vibe', 'separ', 'area', 'gift', 'shop', 'didnt', 'much', 'warhol', 'stuff', 'goofi', 'stuff', 'would', 'find', 'spencer', 'park', 'situat', 'disappoint']

We have courted on several occasions. At first I thought maybe we were destined to be casual flings forever. I loved your eclectic style mixed with your sensuality. I've always loved that you filled your delicious martinis to the brim, but in the back of my head thought you were always just trying to get me drunk. Your menu begs me to keep coming back for more whenever I get the chance.

However, you went above and beyond the other night, and it's all thanks to your delightful server Candace. She is a diamond in the rough and needs to be given a handsome bonus or raise. Do not reward her with vacation though, as I expect her schedule to follow my FEZ cravings from here on out :)

From the get go, my crew of out of towners were suspicious they would not receive their food in time to enjoy it, not be rushed, and be able to make their flights back home. I was selfish and wanted to show them the best restaurant not in walking distance from the hotel and bussed them on the light rail to FEZ.

We informed the staff of our situation and apologized in advance. And we experienced the best service I have ever had probably anywhere in the valley. Our waters were delivered promptly (but without bendie straws.. slight sad face) and we ordered immediately after. Candace never minded repeating the drink menu items as we didn't have but one of those menus on the table for all 10 of us. 

Our food came out quickly and all at the same time. Drinks were delivered with flair. Everyone spent the first few minutes moaning in happiness. Following it were a few moments of extreme gratitude for the delicious food and then a lot more silence as we devoured our meals without feeling like we were in a hurry any longer. 

The bills were brought out.. separate... to everyone right as some of us were about finished and needed to start thinking about a ride to the airport. It was beautiful. Despite gratuity being included, I believe we all included extra because we truly appreciated our service and meals that night.

In fact, I can never finish my fries and FEZ burger so I had half sitting there and one of my friends asked if they could have some of it as it was so delicious the first time he had it.

I love you FEZ, and I always will. You truly impressed me all over again, and left a great impression of what Phoenix has to offer on visitors."	3	1	2	['dear', 'fezw', 'court', 'sever', 'occas', 'first', 'thought', 'mayb', 'destin', 'casual', 'fling', 'forev', 'love', 'eclect', 'style', 'mix', 'sensual', 'ive', 'alway', 'love', 'fill', 'delici', 'martini', 'brim', 'back', 'head', 'thought', 'alway', 'tri', 'get', 'drunk', 'menu', 'beg', 'keep', 'come', 'back', 'whenev', 'get', 'chancehowev', 'went', 'beyond', 'night', 'thank', 'delight', 'server', 'candac', 'diamond', 'rough', 'need', 'given', 'handsom', 'bonu', 'rais', 'reward', 'vacat', 'though', 'expect', 'schedul', 'follow', 'fez', 'crave', 'get', 'go', 'crew', 'towner', 'suspici', 'would', 'receiv', 'food', 'time', 'enjoy', 'rush', 'abl', 'make', 'flight', 'back', 'home', 'selfish', 'want', 'show', 'best', 'restaur', 'walk', 'distanc', 'hotel', 'buss', 'light', 'rail', 'fezw', 'inform', 'staff', 'situat', 'apolog', 'advanc', 'experienc', 'best', 'servic', 'ever', 'probabl', 'anywher', 'valley', 'water', 'deliv', 'promptli', 'without', 'bendi', 'straw', 'slight', 'sad', 'face', 'order', 'immedi', 'candac', 'never', 'mind', 'repeat', 'drink', 'menu', 'item', 'didnt', 'one', 'menu', 'tabl', 'us', 'food', 'came', 'quickli', 'time', 'drink', 'deliv', 'flair', 'everyon', 'spent', 'first', 'minut', 'moan', 'happi', 'follow', 'moment', 'extrem', 'gratitud', 'delici', 'food', 'lot', 'silenc', 'devour', 'meal', 'without', 'feel', 'like', 'hurri', 'longer', 'bill', 'brought', 'separ', 'everyon', 'right', 'us', 'finish', 'need', 'start', 'think', 'ride', 'airport', 'beauti', 'despit', 'gratuiti', 'includ', 'believ', 'includ', 'extra', 'truli', 'appreci', 'servic', 'meal', 'nightin', 'fact', 'never', 'finish', 'fri', 'fez', 'burger', 'half', 'sit', 'one', 'friend', 'ask', 'could', 'delici', 'first', 'time', 'iti', 'love', 'fez', 'alway', 'truli', 'impress', 'left', 'great', 'impress', 'phoenix', 'offer', 'visitor']

The food was still the same. My tre tre was as delicious as it has been every time before. The kool-aid is still filled to the brim in a huge-ass jar and the waffles make my mouth water before I even sit down. 

However, the change in atmosphere just makes it seem fake in my opinion. It's too new, the menus are too new.. our waitress asked us what she should try as she's never had any of it before... and Justin Timberlake was blaring on the speakers. 

Additionally, while this locale does take plastic rather than just cash, and even tho it divides up the bill when you look at it by seat, you cannot split the bill more then 2 ways. This will repeatedly cause an issue for my coworkers. Might as well only take cash.

The place is small and quaint, which is I guess what I would suspect for a hearing clinic. The staff is very friendly and helpful and advised me on the forms I needed to fill out and what would be happening during the testing. They were conversational which put me at ease.

I was so excited when I discovered your flier on my front doorstep that I immediately emailed a friend in the area to see when we could schedule a time to visit. I also couldn't wait that long, and ended up visiting you two days later, craving good Persian food that is so hard to find here. I researched the menu online, but wanted to make my to go order in person to get a good feel for the atmosphere. This is about where the good stuff ends. Be prepared as I now tell you about the sadness I experienced after I walked in the door.

When I arrived, and wanted to double check my order on a to go menu, I was directed to one on a table that had 1\/3 of the items on the menu you list on your site. I then inquired as to other items I had heard of but weren't on this menu. The staff member was surprised and reluctantly handed me a real menu to which I found the items I wished to order. 

So what did I order?

A spinach\/cucumber dip with naan. The dip was fairly delicious but I didn't get to enjoy much of it due to the naan being hard, almost to the point of being stale. Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy? Does it not travel well? 

The spicy chicken dish with vegetables and Persian rice with spices and raisins was just meh. Nothing like the dish I was expecting. The rice was the part I was anticipating most, and the part the gave me the most disappointment. 

The best part of the entire menu was the lemonade I tried which I think was spiced with a bit of ginger. It was delicious. Sadly this was forgotten about with the bad ordering experience, sub-par food experience and the over the top bill for it all.

I may try one more time, this time dining in... but even that scares me a little."	4	0	0	['dear', 'persian', 'garden', 'cafei', 'excit', 'discov', 'flier', 'front', 'doorstep', 'immedi', 'email', 'friend', 'area', 'see', 'could', 'schedul', 'time', 'visit', 'also', 'couldnt', 'wait', 'long', 'end', 'visit', 'two', 'day', 'later', 'crave', 'good', 'persian', 'food', 'hard', 'find', 'research', 'menu', 'onlin', 'want', 'make', 'go', 'order', 'person', 'get', 'good', 'feel', 'atmospher', 'good', 'stuff', 'end', 'prepar', 'tell', 'sad', 'experienc', 'walk', 'doorwhen', 'arriv', 'want', 'doubl', 'check', 'order', 'go', 'menu', 'direct', 'one', 'tabl', 'item', 'menu', 'list', 'site', 'inquir', 'item', 'heard', 'werent', 'menu', 'staff', 'member', 'surpris', 'reluctantli', 'hand', 'real', 'menu', 'found', 'item', 'wish', 'order', 'ordera', 'spinachcucumb', 'dip', 'naan', 'dip', 'fairli', 'delici', 'didnt', 'get', 'enjoy', 'much', 'due', 'naan', 'hard', 'almost', 'point', 'stale', 'whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyi', 'travel', 'well', 'spici', 'chicken', 'dish', 'veget', 'persian', 'rice', 'spice', 'raisin', 'meh', 'noth', 'like', 'dish', 'expect', 'rice', 'part', 'anticip', 'part', 'gave', 'disappoint', 'best', 'part', 'entir', 'menu', 'lemonad', 'tri', 'think', 'spice', 'bit', 'ginger', 'delici', 'sadli', 'forgotten', 'bad', 'order', 'experi', 'subpar', 'food', 'experi', 'top', 'bill', 'alli', 'may', 'tri', 'one', 'time', 'time', 'dine', 'even', 'scare', 'littl']

I have to admit I was skeptical because of the mixed reviews I saw, but I definitely walked away fairly impressed. 

When the first few of us to arrive walked in, we asked for a table for 10 and then proceeded to head up to the restrooms. This was the best decision we could have made for the following reasons:
a) We discovered the mirrored hallway and pink walls. 
b) We also discovered the sexiest bathrooms alive.
3) I would've never known about the swanky reclining booth seating upstairs that was set away from everything else. 

Upon heading downstairs I inquired about the upstairs. I was told it was usually saved for when the downstairs was full, but upon stating it was my birthday party, we were kindly allowed upstairs. We ended up having enough people for 2-3 booths so this was great.

The waiter started out great at first. Refilling water and being patient on the rest of our crowd to arrive. When we all got the point where it was time to order, things started getting confusing and the service started becoming very slow. I received the wrong pizza. I was able to finally get the right one after a little discussion and time, but by the time that happened I had been munching on other things and it was also close to when we were leaving so I had to box it all. Good part? It still tasted delicious for dinner tonight. When the time to get our checks came it got insanely confusing and several people had the wrong items on their checks and had to get a new check printed several times. 

The food menu is limited and the service is slow, so I'm not sure I'd return here for dinner again, but I won't say I will never go back. Their drink menu is AMAZING. I was so excited to see such a great list of champagne cocktails and other items. The place is also insanely sexy. I love the lighting, the music, the seating, and the history of the building.

I went to two dealerships because one I was familiar with and closer to my home, and the other had the exact car I wanted. I should have never made that second trip.

I already put car salesman at a lower bar than other people in my mind, but this was a whole new level of low. If you don't want to end your day wanting to staple things to people's heads, I would stay away from this dealership.

I walked into the dealership knowing what I wanted. I still wanted to browse first, but I had researched. This is also not my first car buying experience, and not my first Mazda. I am well aware of the line. Oh yeah, and I'm also a car fanatic. 

I didn't mind being hunted down by a salesman right away because I had really already knew what I wanted. It was coincidental that without saying what I wanted, the first car he decided to show me was the one I had seen in their online inventory. 

Soon enough I was on a test drive. Great car as expected. I asked some simple questions such as if I could have more details on the specifics of the particular perimeter alarm that was installed on that car to which the salesman did not have an answer. Makes me think it would have been fun to ask him what was under the hood.

We all know that what comes next is the fun part. And by fun, I mean extremely annoying process that takes 10 times longer than it should - the negotiating process. The first part was estimating the trade in value of my car though he decided to wrap this up in the first round of pricing negotiations. Right off the bat I was undercut by a couple grand at least on my trade in. Not cool. 

I told him that the trade in value wasn't acceptable and asked if I could find out the specific price plan I was eligible for to which I received a blank look. I would expect a dealership employee to know the various standard pricing plans. I also let him know I wanted to know what other offers were available. After waiting awhile, he came back with no change in the trade in, but did give me the pricing plan I was eligible for.

Since it was still not where it needed to be, I explained to him what I was looking for. I told him my situation and that I did not need to buy a new car. I told him that my car was perfectly fine and in amazing condition and that I wasn't desperate. I let him know the price I had gotten down to at another dealership and where I ideally wanted to be. I said I didn't want to play negotiation games and I wanted to know how close he could get me.

Things quickly got out of line. I was treated with great disrespect as I was given excuse after excuse and attack after attack. At one point he recommended I lease and when I explained to him I did not want to lease I was given a rant of how I don't put enough miles on my car and it's stupid for me to buy. Really? Okay. I'm out then. If that wasn't enough I was also attacked for asking what the lowest price was. I was asked if I wanted the company to lose money all while he kept informing me that he gets paid on commission, which goes by the number of cars he sells. I guess maybe I looked like I didn't know how car dealerships worked and how the car buying process goes. At one point he asked again where I wanted to be payment wise, to which I told him. He then put a range down on a scrap piece of paper with an x and a line below it and told me to sign. When I said I wasn't comfortable signing a scrap piece of paper below a payment price range without any detail or further information, he became very agitated.

In the end I let him know that this wasn't going anywhere and that I didn't think the price was going to be where I needed it to be. I told him that with the economy the way it is, that I figured the price would be lower. When I purchased my other car in a much better economy I was able to get a better deal. I asked if I could have my pricing plan certificate back and was given a very sarcastic, ""You can have whatever you want.""

I was so repulsed by the way I was treated. I emailed customer service at the dealership and never received a response. I cannot believe they would ignore a situation like this, though with the only other review being a 1, I am not that surprised anymore. 

Slightly more detail is available on my blog, but I didn't want to write a novel here unless it was wanted.

Lunch is just as nice. The staff is great while you are there and really appreciate their customers (and they even tell you).

My favorite breakfast has to be the croissant sandwich (with no tomato) and for lunch I've ended up getting the chicken panini more than anything else.

My favorite is the vig rig that will take you home for free if you don't feel like putting up with their valet, don't feel like parking 8 blocks away because it's the closest you can get, or you are not sober enough to drive home.

I'd like to start off by saying that I was expecting to give Mabel Murphys a 5 star review as the best place to watch a Green Bay game in the Valley, possibly all of the southwest after going there for Packers\/Vikings game yesterday.

However, I never saw the game there, and therefore, can't say that.

For anyone that's a Packers fan that hails from Wisconsin, you should have a picture in your mind of the classic Wisconsin sports bar - Packers memorabilia EVERYWHERE, Leinenkugels aplenty, cheese curds on the menu, that surprisingly homey feel, lots of screaming and fanaticism.

Typically this is Mabel Murphys. My first visit there was for the Bears\/Packers Monday night game last year and it was complete mayhem, and I wouldn't have had it any other way. The typical ""fight songs"" played at Lambeau are played during commercial breaks and screamed by the fans. You can't find anyone in there not sporting their green and gold and it's hard to find a seat or standing spot unless you are there an hour or more ahead of time. It screams home for all of us that left the frozen tundra.

However, I think one hazardous flaw was made this year. They closed for renovation and nothing on their website hinted at anything of the sort. Therefore, people that don't head to Old Town all the time and come those few times a year for the games where being with your own kind is of importance had no idea unless they would've tried to call, and who calls to make sure a Packers bar is open the night they play the Vikings with Favre adorned in purple? Nevertheless, I arrived an hour before the game to find out they weren't open an that nearly a dozen people also did not get the memo. The construction worker there had no suggestions of where to go and there was no note on the door from management. They said they had been having people stop by all day asking, and had no suggestions.

I missed pre game due to having to drive to another bar. Mabel Murphys really disappointed me last night. I really hope they can make up for it. Never get on the bad side of a Packer fan and never deny them of their game.

You're probably asking yourself if I'm serious or if there was something special going on. I assure you I am completely serious and I didn't see anything special.

Everytime I go to my Krav Maga classes or Swadee, I stare at iKitchen and wonder what it is. One time I had an in depth conversation with a friend over what the name implies. Is it serve yourself? Did they just think if they stick an i on it, people will come? Do they sell self-serving stoves and kitchen appliances?

Today it was enough to make me wander in. I saw some pretty good yelp reviews and my curiosity couldn't stand it any longer. The menu looked pretty delicious. After looking over the various noodle, rice and ramen dishes along with the incredibly tempting flavors of smoothies (cookies and cream, green tea... mango mmm), I decided to try a bowl, which serves one and comes with rice and a salad and an appetizer just to have an assortment.

As soon as I said orange chicken bowl, I was shot down. Apparently bowls (which are the items that serve one person) are only served during lunch hours on weekdays. Dishes are served all the time and serve 4 people. I told her I wasn't hungry for a dish and didn't have 3 other people. I would've paid a slightly higher price for a bowl, but instead they let me walk out hungry. The smoothie was still tempting, but I was not about to give them my service. I'll hit up my local fro-yo place instead... and order Chinese take-out elsewhere.

I've been hearing rave reviews about Stax for ages. Hard to believe it took until today to get there, but with a case of the Mondays a coworker and I headed there for lunch hoping some fresh air and good food would rejuvenate us. 

The air was indeed fresh, and the food was delicious. I really loved the laid back atmosphere that we had during lunchtime. And there's definitely something fun about the entrance from the parking lot. 

The menu looked delicious and the idea of items small enough that I can try more than one always makes the indecisive crazy in my happy and quiet. We started with the tots as a starter and chipotle aioli. Presentation is pretty top notch at Stax. I loved that little fryer basket. Reminded me of the little shopping cart at Delux. Love :)

For lunch I went ahead with the exotic burger of the day which was rabbit with mushrooms and tomato and the shrimp po'boy with better battered shrimp, onion, tomato and a delicious sauce... both with no tomato for me. They came exactly as I ordered and were wonderful. I honestly can't tell you which one I liked more; they were both fantastic in their own special unique way. 

Why the 3 stars then? The service left tons to be desired. Everytime we asked a question or wanted to order something, it was like we were being a pain and chore to our server. She always rushed her answers, never looked at us, never smiled, and always mumbled. I wish I could say I ordered an arnold palmer, but it definitely had no tea and the lemonade was so watered down it was as if I simply replaced my cucumber water with lemon water. 

At the end when we had finished our burgers, we still were enjoying our tots. Our server came over to ask if we needed anything else as she cleared our main plates to which we said no.

Then.. the unthinkable happened.

She took the rest of our tots without asking if we were finished. 

I've heard such good things, that I'll give it another go... but if I get bad service twice, Stax is off my list."	2	1	0	['food', 'amaz', 'servic', 'um', 'notiv', 'hear', 'rave', 'review', 'stax', 'age', 'hard', 'believ', 'took', 'today', 'get', 'case', 'monday', 'cowork', 'head', 'lunch', 'hope', 'fresh', 'air', 'good', 'food', 'would', 'rejuven', 'us', 'air', 'inde', 'fresh', 'food', 'delici', 'realli', 'love', 'laid', 'back', 'atmospher', 'lunchtim', 'there', 'definit', 'someth', 'fun', 'entranc', 'park', 'lot', 'menu', 'look', 'delici', 'idea', 'item', 'small', 'enough', 'tri', 'one', 'alway', 'make', 'indecis', 'crazi', 'happi', 'quiet', 'start', 'tot', 'starter', 'chipotl', 'aioli', 'present', 'pretti', 'top', 'notch', 'stax', 'love', 'littl', 'fryer', 'basket', 'remind', 'littl', 'shop', 'cart', 'delux', 'love', 'lunch', 'went', 'ahead', 'exot', 'burger', 'day', 'rabbit', 'mushroom', 'tomato', 'shrimp', 'poboy', 'better', 'batter', 'shrimp', 'onion', 'tomato', 'delici', 'sauc', 'tomato', 'came', 'exactli', 'order', 'wonder', 'honestli', 'cant', 'tell', 'one', 'like', 'fantast', 'special', 'uniqu', 'way', 'star', 'servic', 'left', 'ton', 'desir', 'everytim', 'ask', 'question', 'want', 'order', 'someth', 'like', 'pain', 'chore', 'server', 'alway', 'rush', 'answer', 'never', 'look', 'us', 'never', 'smile', 'alway', 'mumbl', 'wish', 'could', 'say', 'order', 'arnold', 'palmer', 'definit', 'tea', 'lemonad', 'water', 'simpli', 'replac', 'cucumb', 'water', 'lemon', 'water', 'end', 'finish', 'burger', 'still', 'enjoy', 'tot', 'server', 'came', 'ask', 'need', 'anyth', 'els', 'clear', 'main', 'plate', 'said', 'nothen', 'unthink', 'happenedsh', 'took', 'rest', 'tot', 'without', 'ask', 'finish', 'ive', 'heard', 'good', 'thing', 'ill', 'give', 'anoth', 'go', 'get', 'bad', 'servic', 'twice', 'stax', 'list']

I have only had one day at the gym so far, but was so impressed by what I saw, encountered, and learned that I needed to tell my story. 

Saturday I headed there to make use of the personal training that was available to me for the weight loss competition Gangplank is putting on. I have my own gym, and I love going there for the dance classes, but I figured a personal trainer couldn't hurt. I'd had one before at a previous gym and it was great. 

I arrived not really knowing what to expect other than I was going to have a person assessment done that would then be used as a periodic benchmark to measure my progress. 

Competitive Fitness is a small gym with a big personality. They strive to help people maintain a healthy lifestyle, not to make people lose a million pounds. There are only two types of machines available - the treadmill which is used for warming up and the rowing machines. Most of the exercises done are based on movements the body does naturally.

I was greeted almost immediately upon entering and was brought to a treadmill to warm up while one of the trainers, Sally, went over what I would be doing that day and how the gym works. About halfway into it, I met with Jason, who was going to be going through my assessment with me. I think I gained more knowledge about fitness during this visit than I ever had in my entire life. I also learned I did not know how to use a rowing machine and I am way more coordinated when I'm dancing. 

Then it was time to do my assessment. It was so intense that I was a little light headed and needed a million gallons of water when I was done. Later that day I felt it in my legs (and still do today). It was also only 7 minutes. It felt like forever and throughout the entire thing, everyone else in the gym that was working out or hanging around was cheering me on. It was so incredible. I've never felt that level of community and enthusiasm in a gym and it really does help. 

Tomorrow I will start my regular training. Each day there is a set routine or list of exercises everyone that stops in performs. A trainer is there to walk through the proper way to do the exercises and to help along the way. They are also timing you. At the end your time is posted on the board. This not only helps track progress but creates that competitive environment that really does help regardless of what people say. 

It's a great way to think about training and fitness and I'm looking forward to the next few weeks here. Depending on how this goes, I am looking to switch from my current gym to this one when my membership runs out. If I could pay for two at one time, I might consider doing it sooner."	1	0	0	['intens', 'invigor', 'workout', 'entir', 'life', 'last', 'slightli', 'minut', 'one', 'day', 'gym', 'far', 'impress', 'saw', 'encount', 'learn', 'need', 'tell', 'stori', 'saturday', 'head', 'make', 'use', 'person', 'train', 'avail', 'weight', 'loss', 'competit', 'gangplank', 'put', 'gym', 'love', 'go', 'danc', 'class', 'figur', 'person', 'trainer', 'couldnt', 'hurt', 'id', 'one', 'previou', 'gym', 'great', 'arriv', 'realli', 'know', 'expect', 'go', 'person', 'assess', 'done', 'would', 'use', 'period', 'benchmark', 'measur', 'progress', 'competit', 'fit', 'small', 'gym', 'big', 'person', 'strive', 'help', 'peopl', 'maintain', 'healthi', 'lifestyl', 'make', 'peopl', 'lose', 'million', 'pound', 'two', 'type', 'machin', 'avail', 'treadmil', 'use', 'warm', 'row', 'machin', 'exercis', 'done', 'base', 'movement', 'bodi', 'naturallyi', 'greet', 'almost', 'immedi', 'upon', 'enter', 'brought', 'treadmil', 'warm', 'one', 'trainer', 'salli', 'went', 'would', 'day', 'gym', 'work', 'halfway', 'met', 'jason', 'go', 'go', 'assess', 'think', 'gain', 'knowledg', 'fit', 'visit', 'ever', 'entir', 'life', 'also', 'learn', 'know', 'use', 'row', 'machin', 'way', 'coordin', 'im', 'danc', 'time', 'assess', 'intens', 'littl', 'light', 'head', 'need', 'million', 'gallon', 'water', 'done', 'later', 'day', 'felt', 'leg', 'still', 'today', 'also', 'minut', 'felt', 'like', 'forev', 'throughout', 'entir', 'thing', 'everyon', 'els', 'gym', 'work', 'hang', 'around', 'cheer', 'incred', 'ive', 'never', 'felt', 'level', 'commun', 'enthusiasm', 'gym', 'realli', 'help', 'tomorrow', 'start', 'regular', 'train', 'day', 'set', 'routin', 'list', 'exercis', 'everyon', 'stop', 'perform', 'trainer', 'walk', 'proper', 'way', 'exercis', 'help', 'along', 'way', 'also', 'time', 'end', 'time', 'post', 'board', 'help', 'track', 'progress', 'creat', 'competit', 'environ', 'realli', 'help', 'regardless', 'peopl', 'say', 'great', 'way', 'think', 'train', 'fit', 'im', 'look', 'forward', 'next', 'week', 'depend', 'goe', 'look', 'switch', 'current', 'gym', 'one', 'membership', 'run', 'could', 'pay', 'two', 'one', 'time', 'might', 'consid', 'sooner']

I have to admit, when they were building this plaza, my friends and I tried to guess every day what it was going to be. We had it narrowed down to a Chipotle or a sushi joint (both would kill me for sure) and I cannot believe we were actually right. 

I am pretty pleased with this place. Both times I've stopped by it's been clean and pretty speedy service. Every time I come in, I am surprised by all the extra room around to the side and out on the patio and it makes me happy.

I'm sure anyone reading this has been to Chipotle, but if not, or if you're feeling like trying something new.. my signature dish for the past few years has been carnitas bowl with black beans, corn, fajita, lettuce and a little bit of the dairy stuff.

The Herberger is in a great location and is a great venue to see a show. The staff is always really friendly and the space is always clean. It has class without being too stale and old. Like downtown hipster class. It's nice. Soothing. Fun. Good for all ages. 

The bar inside also has a window for the outside patio which is great for nice evenings and intermissions :) Also, if you're lucky you will see some musical troubadours outside as well.

One awesome thing is that you can get parking validated for the Arizona Center for $3. You park there, take your ticket, then go to the Herberger box office and get a validation ticket. When you exit the Arizona Center, enter the ticket you got when you parked and then the validation one.

So now you have no more excuses not to go (if the light rail didn't help already).

I was in the area with a friend to see a band play and remembered someone mentioning they liked Totties. After the show, we hopped in to see what it was all about. The restaurant smelled intoxicating. If that wasn't enough the decor wooed me in the rest of the way. We were seated promptly and given menus to review. 

One of my favorite things off the bat was that our waitress Naomi didn't ask us what we wanted to drink, she asked if we wanted anything aside from water. I liked knowing that either way, I was getting something while I made a decision on dinner. 

And, well, that was a pretty hard decision. The menu has countless items I am still craving now after reading them hours before. I ended up having the red salmon curry, which was accompanied by sticky rice and steamed zucchini, broccoli, sprouts, carrots, mushrooms, and bamboo shoots. It was so phenomenal that half of me was sad I was unable to finish it all but the other half was excited my taste buds would get to experience it for lunch tomorrow. 

The service was truly top notch and everything was prompt and genuine. From our server to the owner, I can do nothing but compliment them repeatedly. That alone makes me anxious to return. You don't see this level of service much these days.

If you want a nice, quiet, gorgeous, friendly, and inexpensive place to eat, you will definitely find a home at Totties.

I now kinda feel like I make up reasons to bring my car in so I can cowork at the awesome desk in the new sexy space 180 just moved into. Headlight out? 180 should be able to fix that. I feel like my exhaust pipe may be loose but I may simply be paranoid? 180 can check that for me. I don't like the song on the radio? 180 can fix that (well probably not, but I can still cowork while they amuse me).

The fact that there are more bays also means my typical maintenance gets done so much quicker too. I've been able to get in and out of the shop in an hour or so. And there's space to sit there. And a desk!!!!! A real desk. So I can sit down and be an adult and connect to the VPN and do all that work stuff. 

And the rest of the stuff I've always loved has still stayed the same. It's locally owned by and operated by some kick ass women. They always tell me what's going on with my car in a completely no bullshit, non-condescending way. The prices are reasonable. And they are very friendly. Most importantly, they truly care. 

Oh and, they're reusable cups they give as presents are amazing and well designed. Love!

Unabridged: I was excited for the chance to finally hit Citizen Public House. I know I know. But if you want to up my chances of going anywhere in Scottsdale, make them available during lunch hours. 

At first glance I was only somewhat impressed. The decor and feel was very empty and sparse. Almost as if it had no vibe, but I'd heard great things about the food and beverage selection, and the hostess gave me props on my Pliny the Elder shirt (hopefully she wasn't making fun of me), so I was anxious to see what else was in store.

It was a Saturday night around 7, and apparently the place was booked until 9, though it looked really empty, and we were promised it would liven up soon as we sat at the bar.

The bacon fat popcorn quickly started to make up for the concerns I had. The whiskey concoction I had started to as well, until I realized they did have 12 and 18 year Jameson reserve but told me they didn't when I asked if my drink could be made with that.

The recommendation to have the Chopped Salad pretty much was the most amazing thing ever. It changed my life. It is my quest now to recreate this masterpiece in my home. I cried when I finished. I didn't want it to end, and I typically don't even like arugula!!

So the day wasn't a bust and I definitely will head back again. The company I surround myself with makes up for sparse decor and now I know better than to believe they don't have Jameson reserve.  Maybe it was my fault for dressing in bright colors and my weird style.

The little art shops and gardens are just beautiful and everyone is so nice and kind. I spent quite a bit of my stay there today playing with an adorable boston terrier. 

Downfall is the lack of good places I felt safe parking my bike. Bonus is I just brought it with me (consider it my dog) wherever I traveled.

Yep. I said it. I'm not taking it back either. I got me some bomb ass bowling shoes that I actually want. Where do they buy these fantastic things? Mine were this awesome almost olive green color with burgundy laces. Fan-flippin-tastic.

The inside of the bowling alley surprised me and made me smile. The tables were actually exquisite. Yes I also used the word exquisite in regards to bowling alley decor. The bar was gorgeous too. The animations and clips between frames and so forth were a little odd and unexpected but pretty hysterical. I loved the murals on the sides of the lanes that worked perfectly with the cosmic bowling lighting as well as the mural on the back wall near the bar that showed a tale of bowling long ago.

Some of the set up of the alley was awkward, such as the huge tables being out of reach from the bowling area and therefore are probably only used in leagues. The bowling area seating wasn't anywhere near as exquisite and had no place to put your drink but on top of the bowling ball shelf. 

The music was hopping though the transitions between the songs could've been better and some of the songs were repeated. However, the birthday medley that was played in my honor was an amazing mix.

Having an excuse to walk around the store and check out the wares, the end result was that it was okay, but still made me miss other running stores I had come to love and adore.

Some of the perks?
** When I was finally able to get the attention of an employee to try on some Five Fingers, he was super nice and knowledgeable. We shared running stories and talked about techniques and workshops available through the store.
** They have group runs as well as classes on form and technique that are free. Considering I run like a buffoon, this may do me some good.

Some of the not so good?
** Parking is atrocious. Luckily my little car fit into a spot on the side that requires tetris-esque skill to get in and out of.
** Staff was pretty hard to find. Not sure if they're always that busy or just were because people were picking up race packs, but it took nearly 20 minutes to get someone's attention.

Everytime I turn around or have one little bit of doubt of staying, some new amazing place opens in Mill Towne Center. Aloha is no exception.

After hearing about it from Loveland, I took a break from cleaning yesterday and walked there with a friend and her dog. I was anticipating these flavors I was told about, which I believed were too good to be true. I mean snickerdoodle is my favorite. cookie. ever. but a yogurt flavor.. no way.

From the minute we arrived we were welcomed. It was nice. My friend's dog was given a bone to enjoy while he sat outside. Definite bonus points there. We were each given a couple cups to sample some flavors first. I was pondering the base of my creation... snickerdoodle or pineapple. Both were excellent. I finally decided on Snickerdoodle mixed with cake batter, thinking it would be a good combo. I also added some almonds and reese's peanut butter cup.

I was shocked at how low the price was and how delicious it tasted. The cake batter was okay and the snickerdoodle was phenomenal. However, next time I think I need to add more almond. It completely hit the spot and I think my punch card may just be full before long. I mean, since I'm walking there and back it means I can go more than I told myself I could right?

The decor in the place isn't that bad for me. I think the couch idea is great, but I'd love to see more color in there.. maybe mix in some yellows or other tropical tones and not be afraid of using some white :)

I'm also hoping for some other toppings such as coconut, and maybe some pineapple. Curious about what flavors are to behold. Banana? Now banana, pineapple, raspberry would be a great combination!!

As my luck would have it, my doctor only had the pediatric one available and suggested I try to find a clinic that would have it. I checked various drug stores and pharmacies only to find that they only gave them out on certain days. Even then, I found one that was offering it that same day but by appointment. I call to ask for an appointment and was told I have to also have a prescription from my doctor. For a flu shot? What? Okay crazy. Buh-bye!

One of my coworkers found this Minute Clinic so I thought I'd give it a shot. HAHAHAHAHAHHA

Yeah, okay that was bad.

Anyway.

I get there and find a computer-based sign in procedure that was very easy to follow and simple to complete. Way to go for a good user interface! i was then 7th in line. The sign in area clearly told me what I would have to do and that the wait could be as long as 15 minutes per person because they also take sick patients and not just those needing immunizations.

Everyone that was ln line seemed to have left so I was in within 10 minutes. I gave my insurance information to her and had my shot and was out in 5 minutes because everything was so easily completed in my sign-in procedure beforehand. All my questions were answered beforehand and the woman administering the immunization was very nice and helpful.

Later that evening I noticed I hadn't received anything with proof that I got the immunization on that date; just the I Got My Flu Shot Today sticker. I called the 800 number for the Minute Clinic (you cannot call a store directly) and asked them. They were super kind and immediately faxed me the paperwork I needed.

The vibe is like a yard sale and really makes you feel at home. The employees have some pretty swanky aprons I want to steal for my kitchen and are super helpful. Even when you don't think to open a book to check for the price. And even when they said they'd been eyeing one of the items you purchased, wanting to get it in a week or so.

There are tons of items from the 30s-60s mainly, from farmer to modern. There's some new items too, with that old feel, such as jewelry. But mainly, this is stuff I've had a hard time finding on 7th Ave, and at a better price. 

You can tell a lot of attention was made to purchases and decor and that everyone there cares.

I had to call two people and drive around and stop in front of two buildings before I found the south one. Granted, I could've looked ahead of time, but you businesses can't count on that.

Once I got there, finding actual parking for the convention center was hard. I think I ended up in Chase Field's parking.

The building is nice and clean but small. The size suited us well, but there was a lack of easy access to food other than the one cart. Would've been nice to have other offerings even if we weren't in a newer and bigger portion of the center. 

The staff was friendly from the few interactions I had and the rooms were decent sized. However, when the air was turned on, there was a buzzing sound in every room that was similar to a vacuum being ran. Had to deal with it unless you wanted to sweat.

It is rather small and cramped and I found things not always labeled so you had to rummage through racks and find tags to see what items were as some things will typically look the same but are quite different.

I found most of what I needed aside from a multi-tool that had both a Phillips and a Flathead screwdriver. This was coughed up to it being Halloween which is their busiest time. Not sure who is buying a specific multi-tool just for Halloween, but okay.

I went in needing something different, something fun to change up some spaces. Looking through the store I was more worried that none of the displays matched what I wanted exactly more than the price. Hesitant, I went to the counter and asked to look at some flush mount lights for a hallway that are more of a brushed metal finish.

What did I end up finding? Lights for everything I needed that were exactly what I was picturing in my head. The price probably exceeds Home Depot, but these aren't your typical lights. After doing some price comparison, the lights were very reasonably priced and I went in the next day to place an order. Jennifer, the woman that helped me previously, answered all my questions and helped me with everything. In the end, they were even able to swing a discount on some of the items, thus lowering the price more.

If you are looking for lights in Phoenix, please ignore all the misconceptions about insanely high prices at Hinkley's.

I had the carnitas burrito minus the pico de gallo (ew tomatoes) and it was phenomenal. The perfect size. The perfect combination and proportion of ingredients. Carnitas that made me want to marry it. 

There was a long wait for tables so I ordered my food to go. I put my name in as well but had already eaten because I was starving. I sat at a table ready to crank out some work while waiting for a flight. 

Getting into a table with a carry on and a laptop bag is nearly impossible. I don't know why restaurants in airports continue to do this. This is a new restaurant. I really wish they had gotten it right.

When my server arrived, I notified him that I had ordered no more than 20 minutes ago, but that tables weren't available at the time, and that since I was already finished, I'd just like a glass of water. 

After 5 minutes he came back with my water and informed me in a very condescending manner that when the wait for tables filled up again, he would have to ask me to leave, because even though I ate while tables were not available,  I was not considered a paying customer.  

This is where the stars dropped to three. Why 2 then?

If he was serious, that's bullshit. If he was saying it to clear the table, it's still bullshit. And that's exactly what I did. As soon as I got to a stopping point I got up and left. No one said see you again soon. No one said have a good flight. In fact, I heard him laugh as I walked away. 

I'm sorry, but in an airport, you need to be sensitive to why someone is sitting in your restaurant. Sometimes it's because it's the only decent choice. Sometimes it's because they arrived batshit early scared to miss their flight. And sometimes, it's because their flight is delayed a few hours and they don't want to sit on a crappy airport chair. Or there isn't even one of those available.  Most of those scenarios are not good. You have a captive audience. People aren't driving from downtown Phoenix to Sky Harbor to eat at the airport Blanco and go home immediately after. And if I am starving and I order take out because a table is not available but still want to sit, don't be an ass.

I love your food, but the service is enough that I'll go elsewhere next time. It may even drive me to a chain restaurant down the hall."	4	2	3	['start', 'everi', 'intent', 'good', 'review', 'place', 'food', 'amaz', 'love', 'give', 'prop', 'local', 'joint', 'pop', 'sky', 'harbor', 'carnita', 'burrito', 'minu', 'pico', 'de', 'gallo', 'ew', 'tomato', 'phenomen', 'perfect', 'size', 'perfect', 'combin', 'proport', 'ingredi', 'carnita', 'made', 'want', 'marri', 'long', 'wait', 'tabl', 'order', 'food', 'go', 'put', 'name', 'well', 'alreadi', 'eaten', 'starv', 'sat', 'tabl', 'readi', 'crank', 'work', 'wait', 'flight', 'get', 'tabl', 'carri', 'laptop', 'bag', 'nearli', 'imposs', 'dont', 'know', 'restaur', 'airport', 'continu', 'new', 'restaur', 'realli', 'wish', 'gotten', 'rightwhen', 'server', 'arriv', 'notifi', 'order', 'minut', 'ago', 'tabl', 'werent', 'avail', 'time', 'sinc', 'alreadi', 'finish', 'id', 'like', 'glass', 'water', 'minut', 'came', 'back', 'water', 'inform', 'condescend', 'manner', 'wait', 'tabl', 'fill', 'would', 'ask', 'leav', 'even', 'though', 'ate', 'tabl', 'avail', 'consid', 'pay', 'custom', 'star', 'drop', 'three', 'thenif', 'seriou', 'that', 'bullshit', 'say', 'clear', 'tabl', 'still', 'bullshit', 'that', 'exactli', 'soon', 'got', 'stop', 'point', 'got', 'left', 'one', 'said', 'see', 'soon', 'one', 'said', 'good', 'flight', 'fact', 'heard', 'laugh', 'walk', 'away', 'im', 'sorri', 'airport', 'need', 'sensit', 'someon', 'sit', 'restaur', 'sometim', 'decent', 'choic', 'sometim', 'arriv', 'batshit', 'earli', 'scare', 'miss', 'flight', 'sometim', 'flight', 'delay', 'hour', 'dont', 'want', 'sit', 'crappi', 'airport', 'chair', 'isnt', 'even', 'one', 'avail', 'scenario', 'good', 'captiv', 'audienc', 'peopl', 'arent', 'drive', 'downtown', 'phoenix', 'sky', 'harbor', 'eat', 'airport', 'blanco', 'go', 'home', 'immedi', 'starv', 'order', 'take', 'tabl', 'avail', 'still', 'want', 'sit', 'dont', 'assi', 'love', 'food', 'servic', 'enough', 'ill', 'go', 'elsewher', 'next', 'time', 'may', 'even', 'drive', 'chain', 'restaur', 'hall']

Rather than categorize by red, white, type of wine, or region, they categorize by the same flavor families such as crisp, mellow, nectar, bold, and I believe a couple others. They are very knowledgeable about their wines and the staff at this location is extremely friendly and helpful. I've been here twice now and would gladly come back. 

The first time was almost a year ago and they introduced me to one of my new favorite wines to buy consistently, New Age, as well as that it's better chilled, over ice, with a lime. Yes, sounds odd. But it's been a consistent bottle in my house.

Last night we headed there to celebrate a friend's birthday and they were having a complimentary wine tasting for their anniversary with food also. They had some amazing wines on the list, including New Age, which I am sure I have everyone hooked on now, and most of them didn't even try it on ice. They also had this wine-a-rita mix that was to die for. I had like two glasses and bought the mix. It's very good with fruit forward wines.

Our party was given our own roped off area outside which was nice considering the gorgeous weather and as a bonus we were then able to listen (and sometimes dance) to the Greek music from the restaurant next door. It was a great place to have a great conversation and enjoy some fantastic wines. This tasting was pick your own from a list rather than everyone having every wine in the same order, and I was impressed at how the staff remembered what we all wanted every time and we had a group of about 14 people.

Sometimes I forget about Wine Styles because it's a chain, but I'm always happy when I end up there."	3	0	2	['despit', 'chain', 'one', 'favorit', 'wine', 'store', 'wine', 'style', 'ive', 'alway', 'love', 'categor', 'wine', 'conduct', 'tast', 'rather', 'categor', 'red', 'white', 'type', 'wine', 'region', 'categor', 'flavor', 'famili', 'crisp', 'mellow', 'nectar', 'bold', 'believ', 'coupl', 'other', 'knowledg', 'wine', 'staff', 'locat', 'extrem', 'friendli', 'help', 'ive', 'twice', 'would', 'gladli', 'come', 'back', 'first', 'time', 'almost', 'year', 'ago', 'introduc', 'one', 'new', 'favorit', 'wine', 'buy', 'consist', 'new', 'age', 'well', 'better', 'chill', 'ice', 'lime', 'ye', 'sound', 'odd', 'consist', 'bottl', 'houselast', 'night', 'head', 'celebr', 'friend', 'birthday', 'complimentari', 'wine', 'tast', 'anniversari', 'food', 'also', 'amaz', 'wine', 'list', 'includ', 'new', 'age', 'sure', 'everyon', 'hook', 'didnt', 'even', 'tri', 'ice', 'also', 'winearita', 'mix', 'die', 'like', 'two', 'glass', 'bought', 'mix', 'good', 'fruit', 'forward', 'winesour', 'parti', 'given', 'rope', 'area', 'outsid', 'nice', 'consid', 'gorgeou', 'weather', 'bonu', 'abl', 'listen', 'sometim', 'danc', 'greek', 'music', 'restaur', 'next', 'door', 'great', 'place', 'great', 'convers', 'enjoy', 'fantast', 'wine', 'tast', 'pick', 'list', 'rather', 'everyon', 'everi', 'wine', 'order', 'impress', 'staff', 'rememb', 'want', 'everi', 'time', 'group', 'peoplesometim', 'forget', 'wine', 'style', 'chain', 'im', 'alway', 'happi', 'end']

When you can't figure out how to use a car wash, there's some major issues. When your steering wheel is so greasy you have to go to the first convenience store to grab napkins to clean it before you can safely drive home, it's a no go.

Unabridged:
In looking for a new car wash, I found one that I definitely won't be going back to. Upon driving up, I couldn't even figure out how to get my car washed. I had to have an employee walk me through it. What??? This is ridiculous people. I know. I know. I design user interfaces for a living, and I am somewhat pickier than most, but it's still wrong.

Having my car washed on the outside and the interior cleaned (no waxing, detailing or anything special) took over an hour. And I wasn't even really sure why. All I knew was there was no good place to sit and wait while watching at the same time. I was bored. And my car seemed to just sit there. 

But what finally put the icing on the cake?

First, the air freshener was put in even though I told them I didn't want one. Secondly, I couldn't even drive my car home. The steering wheel was so greasy from whatever they used to clean it, that I had to pull over and wipe it off before I could safely continue driving home. It took a few days to get all of it off my steering wheel again.

On my scale it's a 3.5, but I had to bump it up to a 4 after thinking about all the other horrid airport experiences I've had elsewhere.

Here are my favorite things about Sky Harbor:
-- Traffic to the airport is usually not that bad
-- Free Wifi, which you think would be common, surprisingly is not in most airports, but is fantastic at Sky Harbor
-- Easy to navigate and get through security and where you need to go
-- Clean
-- Typically not crowded and not a bad place to be if you end up there early. I usually sprawl out, and sit and read a book, do some work, catch up on miscellaneous tasks very easily without feeling cramped or some person trying to strike up a conversation with me

Some downsides:
-- It's hard to find an outlet that works depending on what terminal you are at
-- It's nice to have rental cars all in one spot but if you ever need one that place is like a bottleneck and it can take awhile.
-- One time I had to go to the continental cargo facility and it took me 45 minutes to find it"	3	0	1	['sky', 'harbor', 'airport', 'bad', 'youv', 'airport', 'youll', 'clearli', 'understand', 'scale', 'bump', 'think', 'horrid', 'airport', 'experi', 'ive', 'elsewhereher', 'favorit', 'thing', 'sky', 'harbor', 'traffic', 'airport', 'usual', 'bad', 'free', 'wifi', 'think', 'would', 'common', 'surprisingli', 'airport', 'fantast', 'sky', 'harbor', 'easi', 'navig', 'get', 'secur', 'need', 'go', 'clean', 'typic', 'crowd', 'bad', 'place', 'end', 'earli', 'usual', 'sprawl', 'sit', 'read', 'book', 'work', 'catch', 'miscellan', 'task', 'easili', 'without', 'feel', 'cramp', 'person', 'tri', 'strike', 'convers', 'mesom', 'downsid', 'hard', 'find', 'outlet', 'work', 'depend', 'termin', 'nice', 'rental', 'car', 'one', 'spot', 'ever', 'need', 'one', 'place', 'like', 'bottleneck', 'take', 'awhil', 'one', 'time', 'go', 'continent', 'cargo', 'facil', 'took', 'minut', 'find']

I sometimes cry a bit that the clothing is a little more mainstream than the other items, but I typically find a few basic pieces I should grab. 

One awesome upside is the bags are durable and the straps long enough you can put the bag over your shoulder like a tote.. and the inside is bright pink.

My first encounter was towards the beginning of this year when I swung by for a peak during an event. I absolutely fell in love with the space and the concept. Since then, I have been holding my IxDA Phoenix events there and heading to Gangplank for other meetings and events. They have been so helpful by not only allowing me to hold IxDA Phoenix there, but also asking me if I'd like a permanent spot on their calendar. 

It's a perfect spot to foster collaboration, ideas, and discussion. There are white boards, tons of tables and chairs, wifi and so much more. People are always there to bounce ideas off of, and you can't help but be inspired when you sit down and get ready to accomplish a goal.

Most recently I was there for the ReOpen Phoenix event last night. I love music and get a kick out of seeing the results of collaboration of different styles and genres so I thought I would sit in for a bit and have a listen. I ended up staying there until the very end. The music was fantastic, it was great to meet new people, and I ended up being able to get some work done all at the same time.

A coworker and I were craving some sushi, and they love Stingray, so I decided to give it a whirl. I was well warned of the teasing that could easily be done to all the fantasy perfect waitresses, so this I was expecting (and somewhat looking forward to).

I have to admit I wasn't all that impressed with the inside, but I did really enjoy the patio area. It was the perfect place to relax and people watch, which was most excellent that day in particular. The place settings were appreciated, as a lot of places do not offer a stone or cradle to rest your sticks on.. and hell, even my home set has cradles. I made sure of that. 

Also, while the service was good... I think everyone set my expectations pretty high for the waitresses... I was unable to do any harassing. Sad face.

One suggestion if you go... try the green tea. Two reasons. First,  the cups are incredible. I love them. I am considering it a collect them all game and will try to make damn sure I do. Second, the tea is delicious. I had two amazing cups.

The sushi isn't all that bad either. It could've been just me, but I found the selection of sushi a little limited and the specialty ones pretty overpriced, but the sushi I had was out of this world. I had the spicy scallop and the summertime soy paper roll. I seriously gobbled down that summertime roll fast and impressed many. 

I'll probably be back if I crave sushi at lunchtime again. However, I really get disappointed at the prices of the ones I would like to try (especially for lunch) and think I may run out of new dishes to try soon."	0	1	0	['continu', 'week', 'lunch', 'ventur', 'day', 'stingray', 'cowork', 'crave', 'sushi', 'love', 'stingray', 'decid', 'give', 'whirl', 'well', 'warn', 'teas', 'could', 'easili', 'done', 'fantasi', 'perfect', 'waitress', 'expect', 'somewhat', 'look', 'forward', 'toi', 'admit', 'wasnt', 'impress', 'insid', 'realli', 'enjoy', 'patio', 'area', 'perfect', 'place', 'relax', 'peopl', 'watch', 'excel', 'day', 'particular', 'place', 'set', 'appreci', 'lot', 'place', 'offer', 'stone', 'cradl', 'rest', 'stick', 'hell', 'even', 'home', 'set', 'cradl', 'made', 'sure', 'also', 'servic', 'good', 'think', 'everyon', 'set', 'expect', 'pretti', 'high', 'waitress', 'unabl', 'harass', 'sad', 'faceon', 'suggest', 'go', 'tri', 'green', 'tea', 'two', 'reason', 'first', 'cup', 'incred', 'love', 'consid', 'collect', 'game', 'tri', 'make', 'damn', 'sure', 'second', 'tea', 'delici', 'two', 'amaz', 'cupsth', 'sushi', 'isnt', 'bad', 'either', 'couldv', 'found', 'select', 'sushi', 'littl', 'limit', 'specialti', 'one', 'pretti', 'overpr', 'sushi', 'world', 'spici', 'scallop', 'summertim', 'soy', 'paper', 'roll', 'serious', 'gobbl', 'summertim', 'roll', 'fast', 'impress', 'mani', 'ill', 'probabl', 'back', 'crave', 'sushi', 'lunchtim', 'howev', 'realli', 'get', 'disappoint', 'price', 'one', 'would', 'like', 'tri', 'especi', 'lunch', 'think', 'may', 'run', 'new', 'dish', 'tri', 'soon']

The best feature though I have to say is their insanely easy to use online ordering. Being in the user experience industry, I'm frustrated with online ordering 95% of the time. Z makes me happy though. I actually sometimes miss them if I don't order occasionally. You can customize any item with almost anything you can think of and it's very easy to walk through.

As usual, I was craving Thai tonight. Not that this is really a surprise. I wanted something decadent and full of flavor, spices, and heat. Due to talking I believe, we passed Thai Elephant which is what I intended to try and instead hit Thai Basil. 

I do have to give them props for having a seriously cute interior in a small plaza establishment. I was told that it's usually packed, which might've scared me considering how small it actually was. However tonight it was pretty slow. 

I ordered cashew chicken hot. The sticky rice was perfection and the cashew chicken was definitely hot. However, I didn't get all the flavor I have from other Thai places. I left wanting a little more in the way of flavor and spices. However, the dish was very fresh and healthy.

Not being able to wait any longer, I decided to venture over on the 2nd night. It was better than I expected, though I'm not quite sure why I would've expected less. 

The decor is EFFING ADORABLE. Period. Exposed brick, a white clean look and argyle? Yes please. In fact, I want that argyle wall in my house. I demand it be done.

Everyone was super helpful when I paced and wandered.. wondering just what to get for my first experience. I decided to try two flavors, banana and butter pecan, thinking one would clearly top the other. The result? Both win. So. I got them both. That and a red velvet cookie. I mean, come on, who can resist that?

The ice cream is just what this area has been missing all along. I was secretly hoping for an endless bowl the entire time, though my stomach was clearly telling me I needed to stop indulging. It had the right amount of sweet and salty combined and was just pure heaven. Especially when eaten on the gorgeous patio they share with Windsor. 

Why the 4 stars then? The cookie. Oh that cookie needs some work. The entire outer edge was hard and nearly stale. I think it was due to sitting out all day, but that still should've been remedied. My grandma can send me cookies from 4 states away that still manage to get there soft as they were out of the oven. Maybe that's why I demand more out of my cookies. Don't worry though, I'll be back... but you will need to try harder to woo me next time.

P.S. I saw what appeared from context to be the owners\/managers of the establishment roaming about the entire hour or so I was there.

Seeing that it's closed on Sundays (thanks Gabi!) I convinced a friend (okay it didn't take any convincing at all) to head to Swaddee in our continuing search for best Thai food in Phoenix.

Swaddee is hidden away in the corner of a plaza, but the inside decor does not disappoint. It's not too large and not too small. Rather, it's just the right size. The tables were simple. We had a one with a black cloth, an image centered in the middle, and a glass overlay but I was completely drawn to it. 

We started our meal with the small portion of Tom Ka with chicken and it was amazing. Some of the best I've had. It had the right amount of spices and flavor as well as the right amount of heat. My main course was the pineapple curry (medium), which was just as incredible. It was a little hotter than medium, which was perfect and full of flavor. The shrimp were huge and delicious and the pineapple was fresh. For dessert, my friend ordered the coconut ice cream and I ordered the golden banana (banana and coconut in a spring roll). We ended up each taking half the banana and opening it like a spring roll and putting ice cream on top. Hands down this is one of the best desserts I've ever had. Even if you dine alone at Swaddee, you *have* to order both. I'm not going to lie. I might come back here just for dessert.

Our server was friendly and knowledgeable, and the menu looked fantastic with so-so prices. I ended up getting the primavera dish and stayed with water for my drink. The food was great, even down to the bread. I devoured it with pleasure! 

In the end though, I don't think the patrons or staff were amused with the out of ordinary conversations my friends and I often like to have.

In addition to brow waxing, Danielle's facials are amazing. I recently came back from a 4 month trip that was camping for the most part and she did wonders to help revitalize my face and take away any damage the setting had done. She asked me questions to help determine what the best procedure was for me and made the entire session relaxing and comfortable. This will certainly not be my last facial. 

Tiffany was very patient when it came to my return pedicure. After four months of hiking boots and socks ALL. THE. TIME. .. well except for the shower when I got to wear wonderful flip flops, my feet were a pure disaster zone. I will spare you the horrid detail. It was bad. I was actually a little embarrassed, even though I knew it was typical. I walked out of there a million times better! 

Finally, I came back surprised to find my stylist had left, and scheduled an appointment with Ashley, whom I was told would not be afraid of my sometimes interesting hair decisions. She was fantastic!! Rather than try to reign me in, she helped set me free and even showed me a natural vegan product line to help put the natural curl in my hair.

And so far, The Roosevelt is only one of like 2 maybe? Three at most. I recently went back when out downtown with a friend recently and after realizing we hadn't eaten yet, decided to try out their menu. So, not only is the beer pretty grand, and the atmosphere lovely (well, only when it's not crowded - I like to go on weeknights), but the grilled cheese and tomato soup is amazing. Yes. You heard it here folks. I'm praising tomatoes for the first time in my life. 

When it's not crowded, The Roosevelt is one of my favorite spots. It's like being at a house party before it starts, but not knowing the people. And the house is on a college campus so it's not perfect and not decorated perfect. It has the elements ""the ladies like.""

Coworking (drop in + packages), event venue, meeting space, awesome.

Unabridged:
Really? No one's reviewed Co+Hoots yet? 

Co+Hoots is a great space in an old building on 7th Street near Roosevelt. It's a place for small businesses, the self-employed and anyone else interested to have a space to work that's not their house. It allows for brainstorming, socializing and bouncing ideas off others. There are both rates for drop in one time visits and for packages for full-time inhabitants. 

The work environment is an open collaborative space with meeting rooms to use when needed.

I've been there several times for both professional organization meetings and social events and every time I find it hard to leave. There's such a welcoming vibe and the creativity that abounds in that place is astounding. 

If you need a place to work for a day to get out of your element, a place to call home for your business of 1, a spot to hold a meeting or a swanky sexy space to hold an after hours gallery or social event, this is your place.

Still not convinced? Swing by and check it out.

Ended up here randomly one night while a few friends and I were in the area and low and behold. LIVE MUSIC!!!!! You can't get much better than live music. 

Drinks are a little overpriced and I've seen the cover occasionally be rather high, which is typical of Scottsdale, but still not fun for me. 

The dance floor is fairly decent sized and people actually dance. I've seen Saturday nights get a little packed but there still seems to be plenty of room to see the band and dance. There are other areas separated from the stage and dance floor if you just want to relax. I highly recommend the outside patio for that, which is wonderful!

As usual I was craving breakfast this morning and was able to convince the amazing Tony A. to meet me somewhere. He recommended Ticoz. I will go out on a limb and say this probably ties for one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. Similar to Bri D., I am practice a non-tomato diet, and therefore, usually have issues with many places I eat at. I suspected I would have to order everything today minus tomato. However, I was clearly wrong.

Let's start with the salsa and chips. For brunch. Yum. One of the salsas was pineapple based, which in itself would've made me completely content. Had my breakfast not arrived in a timely fashion I would've asked for them to take the other two away and replace it with three bowls of the pineapple salsa. Establishments that can make a great salsa without the use of tomatoes are hard to find. Along with my salsa and chips (I swear I didn't eat the salsa only with a spoon despite my desire to) I had a $2 mimosa. Yep. Only $2. It was super fantastic and had minimal amount of pulp which I also appreciate, not to mention that it looked sunshiny and happy.

I went with the huevos rancheros for breakfast, which is comprised of 3 eggs any way you like, green chili, pulled pork, and potatoes. Um, please Sir, may I have another? It was one of those just about perfectly sized meals (had I not front loaded on salsa and chips) that made me all happy inside as I consumed it. The server told me it would be spicy. It did have a kick, but a little more of one would've been welcome.

Stepping away from the food, the service was prompt and the staff was super friendly from the moment I walked in the door before I could take my sunglasses off until I was headed out the door on my way home. Very conversational. Very prompt. Very much appreciated. The prices were also extremely reasonable. Although the menu for brunch is limited, at least half the items appealed to me, which means there is hope of a future trip.

I adored the laid back decor which was perfect on a Sunday morning. The colors were warm and inviting and the seating was creative. The bigger chairs at the table though almost don't work for short people, but I managed. I want to go back again.

The downsides?

1) Parking is very limited which caused me issues for the first time today.
2) Seating can sometimes be limited as well. It's a fairly small joint.
3) Being a non tomato fan and sometimes not being in the mood for guac doesn't leave me much of a choice here and my options are pretty plain and limited most of the time.

Store seemed small and cramped and the music selection leaves everything to be desired. It was sad. There were no individual songs and even the amount of books was small also.

Lets just start with the salsa; the lovely, surprisingly dark addictive salsa. I recall at least 4 occasions where I inquired if it was available for take home purchase. Yay once again for non tomato based salsa!

Additionally I had a seafood enchilada that was TO. DIE. FOR. Honestly. It was just the right size for lunch and had salmon, halibut, shrimp, delicious cheese and was made with no tomato as requested. Topped with green Chile it had an amazing flavor that I ended up craving the rest of the day.

Everyone in my group was completely satisfied. Even the meatloaf sandwich lunch special a coworker had looked delicious and I don't even really like meatloaf. 

The service was kinda awkward, for lack of better words, but this completely made me feel better about this place.

For those of you that are not a fan of the tomato persuasion, you know how comforting it is lately to see bruschetta that does not contain tomatoes. Not only does Postinos offer great alternatives, they are divine. My favorite by far though, is the one with pistachios, though I devoured them all. Second fave, roasted red bell pepper. Mmmmmm. Okay need to stop thinking about that. Already had breakfast and am craving food again. 

Our server was super nice and attentive. I felt like I was at a resort being pampered, not out for a brunch with friends. When my champagne, honey cucumber lemonade concoction erupted like Mt. St. Helens and not even the champagne drink champion could down it in time, he promptly came back with a towel to clean the table up. LOVE!

The country toast was mouth watering. I was a bit surprised to see tomato salad on my plate as I didn't see it listed with the item on the menu, but meh. It can easily be pushed aside. More things should come without tomato as a default garnish though.

I ate every last bit of my food and consumed my entire champagne beverage. Not sure that last part is surprising to anyone at all.

The outdoor patio is beautiful though a really tight fit. We were pretty close to a cactus... almost too close for comfort.

I've had a handful of doctor's appointments over the past few weeks, four of them with Dr. Bauer. Not once have I had an issue and every single time there is nothing but helpfulness whenever I have to have yet another crazy unheard of test ran. They've spent countless hours working on the paperwork I need to submit with all the results without appearing hassled or bothered. They've also promptly called me when my results are in or for any other status update I request.

Additionally, they are very patient when my prescription company acts like an asshat. Due to circumstances I needed to have a 6 month fill of my prescription rather than the typical 3 month I receive. When I emailed my prescription company, they told me this was possible if the doctor's office called it in. However, my doctor's assistant tried several times and got nowhere. Today I was there with her and she patiently tried one last time and made sure my prescription went through as requested.

However, if you want a drink that is not on their special menu, it will be just as amazingly delicious but a little pricey. Their pom mojito is incredible and has agave and pomegranate. 

The food is delicious, but nothing super spectacular. My dinner included a cup of their gumbo and the quesadilla. The gumbo wasn't the gumbo I was used to (it was a pretty runny rather than thicker) but it was good. The cup was so huge I wasn't able to finish it. I was able to order the quesadilla without tomato which always makes me happy. It was also delicious. I loved the combination of the spinach wrap and pine nuts and cheese. Mmm.

They have a great list of offerings aside from a basic car wash, such as hand waxing, shampooing, and cleaning the interior plastic and fabric. The prices, in my opinion, for the care your car gets is well worth it. 

The car wash itself is automatic but touch free. You can watch the entire thing from inside the lobby. Additionally, when your car is done with the wash and is getting any additional services, you are able to watch as well from the big patio that is outside the front of the building. Call me over-protective, but if I'm gonna take my car to get waxed and detailed, my pride and joy lil 3, you bet I'm gonna make sure every detail is done correctly.

A bonus is being able to have chips in your windshield replaced using your insurance policy right there on the spot.

The selection is typical pub, and always has something I want, but I do always get sad face when a place doesn't carry ginger ale. Ginger ale is not only easy to make (and no, I'm not referring to the fake make it with coke way.. WTF is that?) but a fantastic mixer with all types of alcohol.

Especially with how absolutely exited I was to go somewhere that had Bratwurst, Berry Weiss AND Cheese Curds. The midwestern girl in me was swooning for my knight in shining armor.

The berry weiss was amazing.... really wish it was on tap, but bottle will do. The cheese curds were sincerely authentic too. I introduced several at the table to their lusty flirtatious ways, and they will never be the same again.

What ruined it you ask? The fact that it took us 40 minutes to pay our bill. When we received it, we realized we forgot to ask to split it and promptly asked the waitress. Her response?

""You should've asked me before you ordered and then I could have done it. However, we normally don't do it at all."" 

What??? Um okay. We knew it wasn't all her fault and tried to split our bill. In the middle of our first attempt, she came by to ask if we were done and we said we needed a few more minutes. Well, come to third try of splitting a check 10 ways she comes back again and asks the same question. Frustrated, we tell her we are not, and she just shakes her head almost like she was angered at us and walks away.

Seriously.. who doesn't split a check these days.. even after the fact. I've seen today's digital restaurant systems. This shouldn't have been an issue. Even if she had to void it and start over it wouldn't have taken her the 40 minutes it took us.. especially because there were only two other people in the entire place.

I am so in love with the experience and the quality of items that I get sad weekends I have to miss it and go to a typical store. It really bums me out to not chat with all the booths, enjoy my Shine latte or arnold palmer (I'm the one that walked around with that pink one like all summer), try out some stuffs and find locally sourced foods to cook meals with the entire week.

Around the holidays, the craft booths get taken to the next level as well. Last year, I was able to buy 90% of my Christmas gifts at Central Farmer's Market. 

In the summer, when it's hot and no one wants to be outside, they fix it by having a mainly all indoors market and even keep the music around. Can you think of a better spot than a place you can shop for great local foods, listen to some local bands and enjoy some breakfast or lunch from the awesome food trucks that stop by? You can even get gift shopping in at the time time too. As soon as they start selling dish soap, toilet paper and other general house supplies, I may not need to go anywhere else.

What are my favorite things to buy you ask? I can't even name just one or two. I love Hayden Flour Mills polenta. I love Gina's  Homemade Pepperoni Pizza. I always have Squarz Pies in my freezer for when I don't feel like cooking. Pinnacle Farm is a great source of produce and I even get various meats there, including some of the best buffalo I've ever had. I also head to Superstition Farm's truck or booth for the hugs :)

The atmosphere is my favorite part of the BOP. It's usually a very relaxing place to be at lunch. I have never been there any other time, so I'm not sure if this always holds true. However, despite it typically being quiet at lunch, the service is usually pretty slow. I typically have to plan on a longer lunch than normal.

The beer selection is pretty good. I can always count on being able to have a Boddington's or a black velvet. As far as the food goes, it's pretty good, but not overly British and a little on the greasy side. 

I've noticed a few spelling errors on their menus from time to time too, which always annoys me.

The truck is adorable and the service is top notch. I don't have to repeat things 50 times and the service is much quicker than I expected.

I ordered the Lady dog which has onions, fried pickles and chipotle cream cheese sauce. I got it on an all beef dog. I added mushrooms to it for something extra.  When I got it, it was piping hot in bread that I think is naan, and if not, is something pretty damn close. It was so good, I didn't want it to end. I didn't want to admit that I had an empty dish in front of me. I wanted to get in line and buy another. But it was enough for a complete meal and I knew I had no one to roll me into my house even if I managed to make it to my car.

It was piping hot, which was good but that combined with the bread made it a little hard to hold. I'm not complaining though. Next time I'll just have to knife and fork it, which is completely fine by me.

Unabridged: European Wax Center was recommended to me by my new stylist when I ended up falling in love with a hair salon that didn't do waxing. I have to admit that when I entered the location for the first time, I thought I was signing up for a cult. Just gave me one of those odd feelings. 

That ended when I went back though and had my eyebrows waxed. It was the least painful waxing I've ever had. The room was clean, my waxer was nice and friendly. She made sure I wasn't allergic to anything. It was very pleasant and the price is super reasonable. 

After my first visit, I was told about a plan I could sign up for. I declined, but was told if I booked my next appointment in advance now, I'd get $5 off. What I wasn't told, was that there was a piece of paper or something I needed to have in order to redeem that, and when I returned a few weeks later, I wasn't given my discount. I was assured I will next time, but we'll see what happens. If the third time proves to have no discount attached, it may be enough for me to leave.

I wasn't really sure what to expect when I walked in, and at first I was overwhelmed. It seemed like a neverending lot of treasures to discover. There were old signs all over the walls, stop lights, the ads in the glass on the tables, a wagon full of 'fixins for everyone to add to their meal.

As I eyed the menu and gazed upon the rest of the establishment, there were a few tables occupied with an older group of friends and a young boy with his dad. There were also a few people at the bar, which I spotted in the other room as I finalized my decision. While I waited, I ordered a coke and loved that they had the digital you can do anything you want with your soda machine. Total win! I think I sat and played with it for minutes. Luckily there wasn't a line. 

Overall the place has a nice relaxing feel in my opinion. It may look like it should be dirty, but I assure you its not. There's a huge part of the restaurant that is not near the bar for the family folk. Outside the bar is a patio that apparently has horseshoes. Oh yes, you heard me right. Who's coming with me to play horseshoes?

I ordered the green chili burger and it was amazing. Lids are offered for the plastic condiment cups at the 'fixins bar for those who are ordering to go, like I was.

What I had hoped for was a lemonade and a muffin. Only thing was, they didn't have lemonade. Boo. Mega mega boo.

Once I figured out where to go to order, I decided on a banana nut muffin and a black cherry smoothie. Speaking of which though, is it ever okay for a customer to not know where to go to order something? Really? I really hope no one thinks this is okay. Luckily, someone behind the counter sensed my frustration and helped me.

The prices weren't bad and everything was ready quickly and I was able to take a seat on a comfy chair in an area no one was occupying. The muffin was huge.

I've never had issues with my eyesight fortunately enough. One of my coworkers recommended Gilbert Family Eye Care and when it comes to doctors, I'd rather go on recommendations than what is closest to my house. 

Being that this was only my 2nd eye exam and my previous one I don't remember all that well, I walked in not really knowing what to expect. 

The receptionist had me fill out the typical forms and I only waited a matter of a few minutes before I was brought back to begin my exam. I went through a series of tests in which each one was explained to me beforehand. It was very comforting to know exactly what I was getting into. Rather than having my pupils dilated I had a photo taken of them, which saves the drama. It was so quick and simple and the results of it were amazing to look at. The back of your eyes look like crazy planets. Just sayin.

The doctor went through the test results and the pictures for me and told me things I never even knew about my eyes and double checked before I left to ensure all my questions about any of the results had been answered. He was super friendly and informative and I felt completely comfortable there. 

What do I wish was different? I inquired about receiving a digital copy of the photographs that were taken and was told they would be emailed to me. After waiting a day I called back, and was told they would be sent today.

I went with high hopes on a Smunch day, having never been and expecting some pretty damn good food. We were able to push all the tables out front together (well, okay, I'll give credit where it's due.. they did this for us) to accommodate our group. And that's where the good stuff ends.

I highly doubt that I was just grumpy that day, because I'm never grumpy on Smunch day, but the prices seemed a little extreme for the amount and quality of food. I don't even remember exactly what I got, which nearly never happens. I just remember having sad face when I finished. Not because it was over.. .but because it was over so soon.. and with so little flair.

The real issue came with our check. No separate checks was an absolute nightmare and they wouldn't even help us figure out how much of the tax was ours etc etc... and I looked borderline annoyed when we weren't figuring it out fast enough. I had to use a calculator people. For real.

Maybe it was the crowd that did the trick, but they knew in advance we were coming. At least a week in advance.

It's overwhelming on top of being poorly organized which is not a good experience. The labeling and wayfinding is a disaster and when you need to figure out which of the 10 sections something could possibly belong in (but is only in one) you stand in line for ages trying to get some type of assistance.

The first time I ever attempted to go there I found some great things, but not at reasonable prices. When I headed to checkout I wanted to scream. What a horrible checkout procedure. The lines are long for not reason other than you have to wait for someone to tell you what line to go to. It's like constantly buying things from Best Buy at Christmas.

Recently I've been on the hunt for a backup for my netbook similar to a battery backup you use for travel with a cell phone or laptop. It's been hard to find something with the same tip. My first try, I was directed to two items. I tried one, which was wrong. 

Today I came back to return it and try again. I was the only person in the return line with four people working and it took me 10 minutes to even be able to speak with an employee. It then took another 10 minutes to return my one item. After that disaster was finally over, I headed to find another replacement. I decided to ask an employee if they knew of any with the small netbook tip. I was directed to the iGos which is what I tried last time. I informed them that I tried a different iGo package last time and the ""netbook"" tip didn't work. I asked if they knew of anything else. They just looked at me and said ""no. do you need help with anything else"" as they walked away.

I attempted to try the other iGo package they suggested but as I found out when I came home, it once again, does not work. Not that they'd care.

I'm sorry. I really hate to give 1's, but I just cannot say one good thing about this store. I've resorted to it a few times since it's close to my house and everyone says it should have all the random odd things I am looking for and at a fairly reasonable price.

The staff was great and always around when we needed another round or wanted to order some food. They also split checks without getting pissy about it. Seems like it shouldn't be a big deal, and you're right, but it usually is.

The patio has basic patio furniture, that while comfortable, wasn't anything spectacular.. but hey.. it's a bar. There also is a brewing room that has tables, but I've been told by people that have been there on several occasions, they've never been allowed to sit in there. Why???????????

I had the light rail cream ale and some hummus. The light rail ale was your basic ale. Good, but not outstanding. The hummus was the best I've ever had.

Honestly my lunch was just okay
Honestly they have a drink called the stigmata
Honestly I am dreading having to give them 2 stars given the hype

But, I am supposed to be honest.

This place has been the buzz since before I returned stateside. My coworkers had also been hearing the same buzz. We just had to go as the finale to our week of lunch. Yeah, I probably would've been better off at the Billet Bar across the street. I mean it is biker week. The people watching would've been stellar. The only people watching I had at RnR was the gorgeous server outside our window on the patio. But even his piece of art body won't bring me back.

The first hint should've really been the overpriced drinks we started with. I figured for that price they should be damn good so I ordered some lime concoction. A coworker got the stigmata. Holy strong... and not in a good way. I mean, I appreciate my drink as much as the next but not when I can't even enjoy it. 

One of my other coworkers on the other hand, was enjoying his blue moon. That was until he held it up to take another sip and the entire bottom of his glass fell off.. yes.. fell in one piece.. onto our table. What happened to the contents do you ask? That went all over him, the table, inside someone's wallet, and onto an iPhone and my face. The waiter wasn't even really apologetic about it aside from giving us some extra cloth napkins which weren't soaking anything up at all. No wet rag, no comp, no apology, nothing but another glass of blue moon we were hoping wasn't bought at a prank store and a sticky table, faces, and sunglasses.

The chicken lollipops were not what I expected, but really weren't bad. I did enjoy those. I also enjoyed the presentation of my fries. Cute silver bucket. Tons of fries. Couldn't finish.

I ended up getting a chicken sandwich that had brie and some other goodness on it. Totally forgot to order it without tomato, but I picked it off easily. 

I know what you're thinking, they serve breakfast here til 2pm, why the hell did the breakfast queen not order breakfast. Honestly, none of it wooed me enough that it looked delicious. They had a make your own omelet that was on my short list of things to order, but I'm glad I didn't after seeing a coworker's tiny ass omelet and bread with no other side for $10. Also, I highly doubt their Amish french toast is all that Amish. Just sayin'. I know a bit or two about Amish goodness.

So, back to my lunch.. it was just eh, which was sad. The description sounded so delicious I really was expecting to be wowed.. finally.. after all the mishaps I'd had up until this point. I do admit I loved the bread. It was delicious. I also appreciated that despite them not having honey mustard, aioli, or anything else to dip my fries in aside from ketchup and barbeque sauce (which was given with the sweet potato fries.. ew) they tried to make me honey mustard. Unfortunately it was just honey mixed in with bottle mustard ketchup. I ended up using the ranch dressing from the lollipops. 

What I paid for this was ridiculous.
The way they reacted to the beer mishap was ridiculous.
The food was meh.
Not even I was tempted to try breakfast there.
It was like the beautiful model that has no brains.... and I want some brain thought going into my dining experience. Don't try to woo me with simple sex appeal.

One of my coworkers commented that maybe in 6 months when the pans are seasoned well after being used the place will be worth it to try again. I told him maybe.

Had to edit that someone from our table got terribly ill too... oy vey!"	12	9	8	['honestli', 'drink', 'overpr', 'hint', 'rub', 'alcoholhonestli', 'lunch', 'okayhonestli', 'drink', 'call', 'stigmatahonestli', 'dread', 'give', 'star', 'given', 'hypebut', 'suppos', 'honestthi', 'place', 'buzz', 'sinc', 'return', 'statesid', 'cowork', 'also', 'hear', 'buzz', 'go', 'final', 'week', 'lunch', 'yeah', 'probabl', 'wouldv', 'better', 'billet', 'bar', 'across', 'street', 'mean', 'biker', 'week', 'peopl', 'watch', 'wouldv', 'stellar', 'peopl', 'watch', 'rnr', 'gorgeou', 'server', 'outsid', 'window', 'patio', 'even', 'piec', 'art', 'bodi', 'wont', 'bring', 'backth', 'first', 'hint', 'shouldv', 'realli', 'overpr', 'drink', 'start', 'figur', 'price', 'damn', 'good', 'order', 'lime', 'concoct', 'cowork', 'got', 'stigmata', 'holi', 'strong', 'good', 'way', 'mean', 'appreci', 'drink', 'much', 'next', 'cant', 'even', 'enjoy', 'one', 'cowork', 'hand', 'enjoy', 'blue', 'moon', 'held', 'take', 'anoth', 'sip', 'entir', 'bottom', 'glass', 'fell', 'ye', 'fell', 'one', 'piec', 'onto', 'tabl', 'happen', 'content', 'ask', 'went', 'tabl', 'insid', 'someon', 'wallet', 'onto', 'iphon', 'face', 'waiter', 'wasnt', 'even', 'realli', 'apologet', 'asid', 'give', 'us', 'extra', 'cloth', 'napkin', 'werent', 'soak', 'anyth', 'wet', 'rag', 'comp', 'apolog', 'noth', 'anoth', 'glass', 'blue', 'moon', 'hope', 'wasnt', 'bought', 'prank', 'store', 'sticki', 'tabl', 'face', 'sunglassesth', 'chicken', 'lollipop', 'expect', 'realli', 'werent', 'bad', 'enjoy', 'also', 'enjoy', 'present', 'fri', 'cute', 'silver', 'bucket', 'ton', 'fri', 'couldnt', 'finishi', 'end', 'get', 'chicken', 'sandwich', 'brie', 'good', 'total', 'forgot', 'order', 'without', 'tomato', 'pick', 'easili', 'know', 'your', 'think', 'serv', 'breakfast', 'til', 'pm', 'hell', 'breakfast', 'queen', 'order', 'breakfast', 'honestli', 'none', 'woo', 'enough', 'look', 'delici', 'make', 'omelet', 'short', 'list', 'thing', 'order', 'im', 'glad', 'didnt', 'see', 'cowork', 'tini', 'ass', 'omelet', 'bread', 'side', 'also', 'highli', 'doubt', 'amish', 'french', 'toast', 'amish', 'sayin', 'know', 'bit', 'two', 'amish', 'goodnessso', 'back', 'lunch', 'eh', 'sad', 'descript', 'sound', 'delici', 'realli', 'expect', 'wow', 'final', 'mishap', 'id', 'point', 'admit', 'love', 'bread', 'delici', 'also', 'appreci', 'despit', 'honey', 'mustard', 'aioli', 'anyth', 'els', 'dip', 'fri', 'asid', 'ketchup', 'barbequ', 'sauc', 'given', 'sweet', 'potato', 'fri', 'ew', 'tri', 'make', 'honey', 'mustard', 'unfortun', 'honey', 'mix', 'bottl', 'mustard', 'ketchup', 'end', 'use', 'ranch', 'dress', 'lollipop', 'paid', 'ridiculousth', 'way', 'react', 'beer', 'mishap', 'ridiculousth', 'food', 'mehnot', 'even', 'tempt', 'tri', 'breakfast', 'thereit', 'like', 'beauti', 'model', 'brain', 'want', 'brain', 'thought', 'go', 'dine', 'experi', 'dont', 'tri', 'woo', 'simpl', 'sex', 'appealon', 'cowork', 'comment', 'mayb', 'month', 'pan', 'season', 'well', 'use', 'place', 'worth', 'tri', 'told', 'maybehad', 'edit', 'someon', 'tabl', 'got', 'terribl', 'ill', 'oy', 'vey']

While the outside still looks temporary, I assure you the inside is filled with happiness and kindness. And yumminess.

It didn't take long before an employee asked me if I had been there before, and explained to me how it works. The easy part most people get is that it works like most other fro-yo places in the area where you make your own concoction and pay by the weight. However, there's lots of organic yummy stuff too. Their smoothies use yogurt instead of milk from what I was told (which sounded heavenly). 

It looked like there were a ton of toppings to choose from and about 7 or so different flavors of fro-yo. Since I was on a smoothie mission though, I didn't take a great while to look at those in detail. I did notice on top of the toppings bar though, a sign that said they always have bananas and will slice one up for you upon request. BONUS!! BANANA BONUS!!

I loved the smoothie options available, as they weren't all filled with strawberries and other things I am not a fan of. Why people want seeds all up in their smoothie is something I don't yet understand. So I ordered a pineapple banana smoothie (my two most favoritest fruits) with some protein and energy boost. 

While I waited I noticed that there were lots of great signs along their walls informing patrons of what separates them from other fro-yo places as well as lovely little sign on how to make your own fro-yo sundae if you are late to the game :). I also noticed they have a club card that is free where you accumulate points per purchase. One downfall is that there isn't much seating - probably about 10 or so high bar type chairs along the back wall, but I've never seen too many people ever sit and eat in one of these joints, so it may not be a complete deal breaker.

It's a small but very cute and super friendly place and I really enjoyed the smoothie. I usually end up making my own because it's more convenient and I can get exactly what I want.

This past weekend I went in for items to put together a nontypical outfit. It was busy, as it typically is around Halloween, but it didn't bother any of the employees. I had several on hand to help me with every small piece. What's even better is that they pretended to be all into my costume and thought it was the best idea ever. Great salespeople skills!!!

From the accessories to the wig to helping me find ways to customize a men's costume as I really don't think every single dress up idea should be turned slutty, they were on it.

I've been there on several occasions and never had a bad time. This past weekend was the first time I stayed there, and it was complimentary thanks to the gift certificates I received when I attended their Snow Ball New Years Eve party at the beginning of this year.

First off, the decor should be enough to sweep you off your feet. The lobby is exquisite and I want that wall treatment in my next house. The rooms are well thought out and modern and stylish. When you first enter, the lights are on for you, and soothing instrumental music is playing from the alarm clock. That right there was enough to make me want to fall asleep. Then I made the mistake of laying on the bed. I have to revoke my claim that I have the worlds comfiest bed. This bed was so seductive that I went to bed at 10:30 that first Friday night. Yes you heard me. 10:30. Lights out for Tonia.

I enjoyed having Gallo Blanco right in the same building as well as the rooftop bar, which made for a great Saturday night. When I left Sunday morning, for some reason my 2nd night was charged to my account, but Matthew, who was working the front desk carefully went through and corrected the situation for me. He was awesome.

My only complaint about the Clarendon is that I'd love to see some cute glassware instead of the disposable cups in the rooms. Also, being that it's an old building, despite having four or five routers for guests, I was never able to get a wireless signal, and was told by the front desk they barely get one either. There should be some way to make that work.

With reasonably priced, modern, comfortable as hell rooms and a staff that will sweep you off your feet, I'll definitely be back."	6	3	6	['seem', 'lot', 'neg', 'review', 'clarendon', 'come', 'never', 'experienc', 'clarendon', 'ive', 'sever', 'occas', 'never', 'bad', 'time', 'past', 'weekend', 'first', 'time', 'stay', 'complimentari', 'thank', 'gift', 'certif', 'receiv', 'attend', 'snow', 'ball', 'new', 'year', 'eve', 'parti', 'begin', 'yearfirst', 'decor', 'enough', 'sweep', 'feet', 'lobbi', 'exquisit', 'want', 'wall', 'treatment', 'next', 'hous', 'room', 'well', 'thought', 'modern', 'stylish', 'first', 'enter', 'light', 'sooth', 'instrument', 'music', 'play', 'alarm', 'clock', 'right', 'enough', 'make', 'want', 'fall', 'asleep', 'made', 'mistak', 'lay', 'bed', 'revok', 'claim', 'world', 'comfiest', 'bed', 'bed', 'seduct', 'went', 'bed', 'first', 'friday', 'night', 'ye', 'heard', 'light', 'toniai', 'enjoy', 'gallo', 'blanco', 'right', 'build', 'well', 'rooftop', 'bar', 'made', 'great', 'saturday', 'night', 'left', 'sunday', 'morn', 'reason', 'nd', 'night', 'charg', 'account', 'matthew', 'work', 'front', 'desk', 'care', 'went', 'correct', 'situat', 'awesomemi', 'complaint', 'clarendon', 'id', 'love', 'see', 'cute', 'glasswar', 'instead', 'dispos', 'cup', 'room', 'also', 'old', 'build', 'despit', 'four', 'five', 'router', 'guest', 'never', 'abl', 'get', 'wireless', 'signal', 'told', 'front', 'desk', 'bare', 'get', 'one', 'either', 'way', 'make', 'workwith', 'reason', 'price', 'modern', 'comfort', 'hell', 'room', 'staff', 'sweep', 'feet', 'ill', 'definit', 'back']

Simply put, everyone needs to visit the Mattress Factory. 

It's very inexpensive and well worth it. You're also allowed to take photos throughout. The staff is very friendly and the gift shop is great. Only downside to the gift shop is they didn't have a shirt in the size I wanted. I requested to be notified when it came in, and here a few months later, I've still heard nothing.

However, the exhibits make up for it. They are very unique not only in the aspect that you won't find them anywhere else, but the mediums are of a large variety. The day I went I was able to go to both buildings. The first one had a lot of wooden and metal exhibits as well as a floor that was completely dark and had some light exhibits. When you get off the elevator it is pitch black with only a spotlight over a plaque on the wall informing the visitors how to get into the rooms. 

The second building had amazing art work in the way of room decor which was great to see.

Meat. Cheese. Potatoes. In bread. Oh and Banoffee pie.

Unabridged:
This is my favorite Pasty location. First off, there is tons of space. Tons. The decor also has a nice relaxing but slightly sophisticated feel. And there aren't a million ASU students prancing about and hardly ever a wait in line when we head there for lunch. 

Vegetarian or not, there's always a pasty for everyone. Every time I've gone to either location, I've never gotten the same one twice, and I still have over 3\/4 of the menu to clear off my list with most of them being ones I would love to enjoy. They're big enough that half the time I end up taking half home with me... though that's probably because I after trying the Banoffee Pie, I haven't been able to not order it since. So usually it's take half my pasty home and split Banoffee, which is the most heavenly dessert on the planet. 

All the items are made there, and if you sit at the bar\/kitchen area you can watch them making them right there in the restaurant. It's kinda fun really. Sometimes I watch a little too closely if I know they're making a favorite, trying to figure out how I can mimic this masterpiece at home. Alas, I've always ended up failing. 

One thing to note is that while they make them there, they prep them in advance so you cannot substitute. However, I've been toying with the idea of calling a week in advance to have a special one made and paying up front so I can enjoy it a few days later.

So, back to this Banoffee Pie deal... I think I need to inform you in advance to save you from desperately trying to resist its allure when you visit due to this amazingly good review. So, it's a pretty awesome dessert. First, you start with a thick graham cracker crust. I am personally not a huge fan of graham cracker, but this isn't your typical crust like on a pie or a lemon bar. This looks like texas toast. For serious. Then add some homemade caramel, homemade whipped cream and bananas. This only adds up to a win."	3	2	3	['abridgedmeat', 'chees', 'potato', 'bread', 'oh', 'banoffe', 'pieunabridgedthi', 'favorit', 'pasti', 'locat', 'first', 'ton', 'space', 'ton', 'decor', 'also', 'nice', 'relax', 'slightli', 'sophist', 'feel', 'arent', 'million', 'asu', 'student', 'pranc', 'hardli', 'ever', 'wait', 'line', 'head', 'lunch', 'vegetarian', 'there', 'alway', 'pasti', 'everyon', 'everi', 'time', 'ive', 'gone', 'either', 'locat', 'ive', 'never', 'gotten', 'one', 'twice', 'still', 'menu', 'clear', 'list', 'one', 'would', 'love', 'enjoy', 'theyr', 'big', 'enough', 'half', 'time', 'end', 'take', 'half', 'home', 'though', 'that', 'probabl', 'tri', 'banoffe', 'pie', 'havent', 'abl', 'order', 'sinc', 'usual', 'take', 'half', 'pasti', 'home', 'split', 'banoffe', 'heavenli', 'dessert', 'planet', 'item', 'made', 'sit', 'barkitchen', 'area', 'watch', 'make', 'right', 'restaur', 'kinda', 'fun', 'realli', 'sometim', 'watch', 'littl', 'close', 'know', 'theyr', 'make', 'favorit', 'tri', 'figur', 'mimic', 'masterpiec', 'home', 'ala', 'ive', 'alway', 'end', 'fail', 'one', 'thing', 'note', 'make', 'prep', 'advanc', 'cannot', 'substitut', 'howev', 'ive', 'toy', 'idea', 'call', 'week', 'advanc', 'special', 'one', 'made', 'pay', 'front', 'enjoy', 'day', 'laterso', 'back', 'banoffe', 'pie', 'deal', 'think', 'need', 'inform', 'advanc', 'save', 'desper', 'tri', 'resist', 'allur', 'visit', 'due', 'amazingli', 'good', 'review', 'pretti', 'awesom', 'dessert', 'first', 'start', 'thick', 'graham', 'cracker', 'crust', 'person', 'huge', 'fan', 'graham', 'cracker', 'isnt', 'typic', 'crust', 'like', 'pie', 'lemon', 'bar', 'look', 'like', 'texa', 'toast', 'seriou', 'add', 'homemad', 'caramel', 'homemad', 'whip', 'cream', 'banana', 'add', 'win']

A fellow volunteer at an event I was working on mentioned that her husband did estate planning and it might be worthwhile to check out even though I am in the east valley and the office was in Glendale. 

I can assure you it was such an easy and carefree experience that I cannot believe I was actually seeing a lawyer. I always pictured it being so complicated and expensive and having things said to me I wouldn't understand without use of a legal jargon dictionary. However, Heath sat down with me and discussed the different types of documents that were available and what they were used for as well as answered any questions I had in regard to them. He also asked questions about my affairs in order to create the documents needed. Ends up I just needed a simple estate planning package with a few different documents. 

I left that day giving Heath the information he needed to draft the documents. Since I didn't live nearby, he emailed me drafts of the documents when they were complete for me to review. I was able to ask any questions I had before hand and when I showed up to pick up the documents, all I had to do was sign and pay the small fee that was charged. Witnesses were available and everything was painless. 

I highly recommend visiting Heath for any estate planning needs."	4	0	2	['realiz', 'prepar', 'deploy', 'oversea', 'sever', 'month', 'sound', 'morbid', 'probabl', 'estat', 'plan', 'case', 'anyth', 'happen', 'case', 'someth', 'came', 'person', 'affair', 'gone', 'unabl', 'take', 'care', 'fellow', 'volunt', 'event', 'work', 'mention', 'husband', 'estat', 'plan', 'might', 'worthwhil', 'check', 'even', 'though', 'east', 'valley', 'offic', 'glendal', 'assur', 'easi', 'carefre', 'experi', 'cannot', 'believ', 'actual', 'see', 'lawyer', 'alway', 'pictur', 'complic', 'expens', 'thing', 'said', 'wouldnt', 'understand', 'without', 'use', 'legal', 'jargon', 'dictionari', 'howev', 'heath', 'sat', 'discuss', 'differ', 'type', 'document', 'avail', 'use', 'well', 'answer', 'question', 'regard', 'also', 'ask', 'question', 'affair', 'order', 'creat', 'document', 'need', 'end', 'need', 'simpl', 'estat', 'plan', 'packag', 'differ', 'document', 'left', 'day', 'give', 'heath', 'inform', 'need', 'draft', 'document', 'sinc', 'didnt', 'live', 'nearbi', 'email', 'draft', 'document', 'complet', 'review', 'abl', 'ask', 'question', 'hand', 'show', 'pick', 'document', 'sign', 'pay', 'small', 'fee', 'charg', 'wit', 'avail', 'everyth', 'painless', 'highli', 'recommend', 'visit', 'heath', 'estat', 'plan', 'need']

The first time I discovered them was due to the fact that they had breakfast all day. And well, if you know me, you know this usually brings a place up a notch in my book. I love my breakfast. Their heaven sent omelet is spectacular.

Their italian soda comes with cream on the side so you can add as much as you want. Yum!!

Additionally the grilled cheese is to die for. I am *not* a fan of tomatoes at all but for some reason their tomato bisque I actually somewhat enjoy. And it comes with cheddar goldfish. Oh yes. And this isn't a kids meal either.

I loved KSU. The campus is gorgeous and so full of history. Many more green pastures than its next door neighbor the University of Akron. Because of the vast size of campus in order to give some character, the buildings could be a little far apart, but it was worth it in my opinion. Some of those walks and the people watching that occurred were epic. 

My professors, particularly in graduate school were amazing and it was fairly easy to find the resources one needed to study or do anything else for that matter. We had our share of fun festivals (we all know the Black Squirrel should be the mascot right?) and campus activities. One of my favorites was the Wyclef concert, though now I'm probably dating myself. 

There's lots to do in the vicinity and always something going on around campus. I mean come on... Eastway Center has a bowling alley (or did).

The Ratt in the basement of the student center is always a good time. I had a few review sessions with professors and classmates down there while enjoying a brew.

On my first visit to this place, I couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised at how new it was. And that the bar was the size of an entire restaurant. And that the restrooms had doors to the alley and to the bar. 

I was here on a Saturday night with friends to celebrate a birthday and we got this amazing deal for two hours of bowling and shoes for $10. The place was nearly empty (I think because it was probably between leagues and disco\/glow\/whatever you wanna call it bowling) and completely pristine. The staff was courteous and we had a blast. 

I still wish that bowling system interfaces weren't so damn unfriendly, but that is hardly a situation unique to this alley.

One thing that was sad was that we really wanted the glow bowling to start early because no one was there but us and we were excited. In fact, 40 minutes before it was slated to start, they put down the projectors in front of the lanes and started some of the spot lights but didn't start the music videos or dim the lights. When I approached them to ask if we could possibly start it early, they said no. I then inquired as to why everything was 3\/4 set up then, and they said, they do it slowly at set times. BORING. I understand if you're busy. But no one was there but our two lanes and one lane that just joined beside us. Out of like 30 something lanes (I'm guessing). For that I will knock you down a star.

I hit another, I want a piercing moods and swung in on a lunch break last week, determined to get this piercing I thought would be perfect on me. 

As usual Jo was absolutely amazing. He brought me back and we discussed what I wanted and when he looked at how my ear was shaped he said that I may want to try something like this (then drawing dots where they would go). He took into consideration my piercing past and said it's subtleness and the petite jewelry would suit me well.

And as always, I came out super impressed and ready to show off my piercings. They still look amazing a week later. I'm still in love, and they are perfectly healthy. Job well done.

I also ended up going back for dinner the very next day.

I liked Moira after I had we had a chance to warm up to each other and get over the awkward first meeting where I expected the door to go the other direction... wayfinding people.. I'm telling you.. even buildings could benefit from great user experience design.

My service both times has been the pace I needed - the first time it was slow so I could just relax, enjoy the atmosphere, and not get to my next meeting too early. The second I had like a half hour and our server was once again on top of the ball and got us out and to the Herberger in just the right amount of time.

The sushi... delicious. I've had a few different rolls and some nigiri as well. The only one I didn't really care for was the yellowtail. My favorite was the ebi nigiri. :) The scallop appetizer was delicious, and Moira gets their spicy rating right. The thai chili on top was just that. 

Given the choice, I will probably choose the bar over a table as it seems they just stuff people in the back of the place and move their way forward, and I wasn't really digging that. I loved the bar and talking with the chefs while I was eating. While sitting at the bar the first time, I even got to watch a lemon juggling act while eating my mochi.. which was DELICIOUS btw. 

I don't live nearby... yet... but with pretty decent prices, this will be my sushi stop when I hit the craving while downtown.

Bonus was the server gave me mad props on my phone wallpaper which is rambo shooting weapons while on a unicorn.

There are at least a few things on the menu I'm still dying to try and I've had a few varying items already. The fish tacos are insanely good and the lunch menu is reasonably priced. The margaritas are some of the best in the area. I typically go with the salty senorita. 

The non-tomato based salsa? The shit.

The decor and feel of the establishment is soothing and relaxing in an odd way and I love it. Additionally the insanely wide variety of music they play has my coworkers and I either singing along, embarrassed about ""that one person we can't remember"", or reminiscing about something it reminds us of constantly.

They have several different classes, all pretty much super ultra intense. Don't go if you aren't really wanting a work out, because you won't get any sympathy here.

My review is based solely on their pasta primavera, which, after trying for the first time, I went back on my own to have it again. Three more times. This is huge for me. 

The portion is perfect sized and the vegetables which is mainly squash heaven is just perfect. The bread that accompanies it is soft and flavorful also. It's truly the perfect dish for a non tomato\/pasta lover like myself. 

The staff is really friendly and always strikes up a small conversation when I come in. The prices are reasonable and for the most part, it seems fairly empty every time I've stopped in.

So anyway, there I was making a daring move to go to a place I'd never been for my birthday (daring to my friends anyway), and it was one of the best experiences I've ever had. We sat at half of the community table, and even the pickiest of eaters found items they enjoyed on the menu. As for me, my eyes saw nothing but the home-brewed ginger ale (I make my own ginger simple syrup) and the chicken and waffles. The food was so amazing, no one spoke during most of it. And while they didn't have dessert really for the birthday girl, they brought me out a scoop of cookie dough, in a cute glass dish, with a candle on it. It was awesome they cared enough to make the best of the dessert menu they had.

The vibe is very relaxing, even on a Saturday evening. The service was just the right speed and not at all too pushy and no one minded our birthday gifts and small chatter.

If you're headed to the parking lots near Lucille's and what not to head to the main strip of smaller stores, you will probably find yourself not knowing where to park in order to get to the specific store you are trying to access. You will be way off base from where you guessed you were and end up confused and lost and bitter. 

By that point, all you want to do is get the thing you came for and leave as quickly as possible. You're not going to want to stay and shop and browse or sit by the outdoor fireplace (which is on when it's hot out.. WTF).

I walked out happy, which means it was a success. 

The highlights? Plenty.

I made new friends. And hey, who doesn't like new partners in crime?

The decor was a great compliment to the night of sexy pretentiousness that preceded it. The couches were fairly comfortable. I loved the exposed brick, the low lighting, the fixtures, the movies, and the music. Speaking of music, songs from the Fugees album The Score were on frequently throughout the night making me want to listen to the whole album so badly that when I got back to my car I spent 10 minutes digging through my glove box to find my copy. I'm still listening to it today.

The service was pretty damn skippy from what I saw. I never had to get up to get my own drink thanks to my amazing friends, but I always seemed to get them quickly. 

The drinks I had were very well made. On the suggestion of the bartender I tried a White Rabbit and also had a lemon drop shot. I usually am put off by chocolate based drinks as I'm not a huge chocolate fan and they always taste fake, but the White Rabbit delivered. I could drink it in a gallon pitcher. With a big bendy straw. And an umbrella. The lemon drop was the best I've had. 

What do I wish was better?

I'd love to see Frambroise *and* Guinness on tap so I could have a red velvet made (my favorite beverage). The up side was I got a can of Guinness and a bottle of Frambroise and was able to make 2 of my own which also meant I could use the proportions i like (30% Frambroise, 70% Guinness).

I decided to go with a Philadelphia and a spicy salmon. I was completely satisfied. It was filling, just the right size, and very well made. 

Happy hour has some great sake and half off roll specials that sound like a great after work trip some lazy middle of the week when I feel like going out but without all the dolled up drama.

I first came across Yucca when searching for a great karaoke place in Tempe. I ended up finding Rockaroke which has since then been my fix since I have no time for a band. 

It's small. It's a total dive bar. The beer is cheap and there's a great list of off the wall beers and I love it! 

It's a great place to go and relax and hear some music and you can seriously not beat rockaroke. Karaoke but with a backup band and not that shitty midi file-esque crap? Yeah. Awesome. 

If you are going on a night when something good is going on, get there earlier than you planned on going or you won't get a seat. It can also take awhile to get a drink from the bar, but I think that's because it can become really packed there some nights.

That's about the extent of it.

I've been here on two occasions. The first was to start my bike search. When I informed a store employee of what I was going to use my bike for and ask what bikes may suit my needs, I was only shown one row of bikes that were pretty much all the same and all by the SAME manufacturer. I was told that was all they could offer me out of the tons of other bikes they had in their store.

The second time I biked there with a friend on my new bike, Lady Eleanor herself as a friend had some questions about her bike. They were fairly good at answering her questions. However, I was appalled when they stopped me dead in my tracks and asked me what was wrong with my bike. I panicked for only a short while til I realized they were going overboard on the fact that my pedals are not where most pedals are since my bike doesn't have much of a frame in the center. The employee kept going on about how it must be awkward to pedal (which it's not) and then called other employees over to gawk and make odd comments about my bike. 

Funny enough on the way out a woman drooled over my gorgeous bike with its interesting design and asked where I got it. I politely told her where.. and it wasn't at Landis."	5	1	2	['time', 'ever', 'return', 'buy', 'simpl', 'accessori', 'knowledg', 'put', 'bike', 'get', 'hot', 'pink', 'im', 'awesom', 'sock', 'love', 'that', 'extent', 'itiv', 'two', 'occas', 'first', 'start', 'bike', 'search', 'inform', 'store', 'employe', 'go', 'use', 'bike', 'ask', 'bike', 'may', 'suit', 'need', 'shown', 'one', 'row', 'bike', 'pretti', 'much', 'manufactur', 'told', 'could', 'offer', 'ton', 'bike', 'storeth', 'second', 'time', 'bike', 'friend', 'new', 'bike', 'ladi', 'eleanor', 'friend', 'question', 'bike', 'fairli', 'good', 'answer', 'question', 'howev', 'appal', 'stop', 'dead', 'track', 'ask', 'wrong', 'bike', 'panick', 'short', 'til', 'realiz', 'go', 'overboard', 'fact', 'pedal', 'pedal', 'sinc', 'bike', 'doesnt', 'much', 'frame', 'center', 'employe', 'kept', 'go', 'must', 'awkward', 'pedal', 'call', 'employe', 'gawk', 'make', 'odd', 'comment', 'bike', 'funni', 'enough', 'way', 'woman', 'drool', 'gorgeou', 'bike', 'interest', 'design', 'ask', 'got', 'polit', 'told', 'wasnt', 'landi']

It was fairly easy to find though parking is a real chore and the signs seem to indicate that only the spaces *directly* beside the coffee shop are for Hob Nobs and that the ones beside the other building are not. Still not sure about that. However, it did also indicate that somewhere on the other side of the road, additional parking existed also.

I didn't have coffee, but I did have a chicken salad with mandarin oranges and pecans that was delish and almost too much for me to eat at one time and on the recommendation of the staff a coconut and lime Italian soda, which was a brilliant and refreshing flavor. Also, thank you. I now have the lime in the coconut song in my head.

Wifi was a definite must and well appreciated and I loved the artwork and decor. The table we sat at was the perfect size for both of us to be on our laptops and eat and work. The music being played was a reminiscent flashback and just at the right level to still enjoy and have a conversation... well until the group of toddlers and tweens arrived. We were soon overcome with tables being pushed together all around us and loud noises. I wish someone would've given us a heads up or informed us a party would be happening.

Yesterday I wanted a relaxing stroll, but was sick of the city, so I drove on up to Shaw Butte to do a relaxing loop. Parking in this location is limited, and a little awkward (almost slashed my tires through the do not enter section) but it doesn't seem to get as crowded and should suffice. 

The entrance has a map of the area and trails you can take. The path was fairly easy to follow and I did manage to stay on a path (tho not always the one I was supposed to be on) at all times. I also managed to get myself back to my car, so that's always a bonus. There were a few others there that had managed to get themselves lost due to unclear path marking, but one look at a map and it's easy to get your bearings straight again. 

The path was beautiful. Not completely scenic, as parts still have the road visible, but it was quiet and peaceful and the sky was gorgeous that day. I pretty much had the trail to myself most of the time with everyone pretty evenly spaced out and ended up doing some dance hiking to my iPod without injuring myself on the trail, which speaks to the ease of the hike. Not really any steep parts or loose rock on the loop trail. Perfect for low maintenance hiking days. 

It was my first trip, but I don't see it being my last.

Sales people are a little condescending. Prices are pretty over the top for anything above one of the three wash packages. One of their employees doesn't know that brakes can squeak some when wet (like after a car wash).

Unabridged:
I've been on a hunt for a new go to car wash and decided to give Danny's a try after a disastrous attempt at another business and a discount I recently found out I was entitled to. I had an hour to kill before a dinner appointment at Tempe Marketplace, and figured it the perfect chance. 

The man that met me at my car tried to read me at nearly every point in the conversation and adjust his next line\/tone appropriately, but made it very apparent he was doing so and it almost made me walk out. I told him I needed a wash and a hand wax and that I had an hour tops in order to have this done. He tried to then sell me on a detail, which my car didn't need at the time. After I told him such he's like ""Oh yeah. Looks like you are right on track of what your car needs and when. The inside looks fine.""

AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.

I was glad to get away from him and inside.

I went and paid and the inside is your typical upscaled car wash approach that's happened as of late. There were some televisions playing various general channels, some snacks, some random shit for your car, some blue mountain greeting cards (I totally thought those were only e-cards from the mid 90's) and some various seating where you can watch your car at different stages. You can also watch outside which is nice. 

I like to watch my car when it's being washed, serviced, what not. I like to know what's going on. Call me an overly possessive parent and you are probably right. My car's my baby. Sadly, I had to move three times in the process of my car being washed to keep an eye on it. I wonder if they do this on purpose. 

When it was done I stood up to head over. A man asked me if my brakes were bad, to which I responded no and then asked why. He told me they made a loud noise. When I told him it was probably because they were wet he insisted it was not and that I should get my brakes checked. Ends up they didn't make any noise at all, it was another car and he didn't know what the hell he was talking about.

On the good side, they did take damn good care of my car, so the next time I feel a little feisty after a long day, I'll head over here to have my car washed."	3	0	0	['abridg', 'sale', 'peopl', 'littl', 'condescend', 'price', 'pretti', 'top', 'anyth', 'one', 'three', 'wash', 'packag', 'one', 'employe', 'doesnt', 'know', 'brake', 'squeak', 'wet', 'like', 'car', 'washunabridged', 'hunt', 'new', 'go', 'car', 'wash', 'decid', 'give', 'danni', 'tri', 'disastr', 'attempt', 'anoth', 'busi', 'discount', 'recent', 'found', 'entitl', 'hour', 'kill', 'dinner', 'appoint', 'temp', 'marketplac', 'figur', 'perfect', 'chanc', 'man', 'met', 'car', 'tri', 'read', 'nearli', 'everi', 'point', 'convers', 'adjust', 'next', 'lineton', 'appropri', 'made', 'appar', 'almost', 'made', 'walk', 'told', 'need', 'wash', 'hand', 'wax', 'hour', 'top', 'order', 'done', 'tri', 'sell', 'detail', 'car', 'didnt', 'need', 'time', 'told', 'he', 'like', 'oh', 'yeah', 'look', 'like', 'right', 'track', 'car', 'need', 'insid', 'look', 'fineahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhi', 'glad', 'get', 'away', 'insidei', 'went', 'paid', 'insid', 'typic', 'upscal', 'car', 'wash', 'approach', 'that', 'happen', 'late', 'televis', 'play', 'variou', 'gener', 'channel', 'snack', 'random', 'shit', 'car', 'blue', 'mountain', 'greet', 'card', 'total', 'thought', 'ecard', 'mid', 'variou', 'seat', 'watch', 'car', 'differ', 'stage', 'also', 'watch', 'outsid', 'nice', 'like', 'watch', 'car', 'wash', 'servic', 'like', 'know', 'what', 'go', 'call', 'overli', 'possess', 'parent', 'probabl', 'right', 'car', 'babi', 'sadli', 'move', 'three', 'time', 'process', 'car', 'wash', 'keep', 'eye', 'wonder', 'purpos', 'done', 'stood', 'head', 'man', 'ask', 'brake', 'bad', 'respond', 'ask', 'told', 'made', 'loud', 'nois', 'told', 'probabl', 'wet', 'insist', 'get', 'brake', 'check', 'end', 'didnt', 'make', 'nois', 'anoth', 'car', 'didnt', 'know', 'hell', 'talk', 'abouton', 'good', 'side', 'take', 'damn', 'good', 'care', 'car', 'next', 'time', 'feel', 'littl', 'feisti', 'long', 'day', 'ill', 'head', 'car', 'wash']

After going to a few other shops and feeling like a burden when I explained what I was looking for but I wasn't exactly sure what the best options would be for me, I stumped into Tempe Bicycle as a last resort. What I found was the gorgeous bike I saw online that I had been drooling over, and Debbie, the best sales rep ever. 

Every type of bike and their pros and cons were explained to me, without hesitation or impatience and without feeling like I was a burden. Any question I had was answered nicely and with a real explanation rather than trying to blow me off by telling me some made up answer that I wouldn't catch on to. 

I was told I could put a down payment on a bike and pay it off in 3 months. Also, if it ended up I didn't want it, I'd get my money back. Really? this is too good to be true, yet I said I'd have to think on it. 

I ended up putting a deposit down the next day over the phone with Debbie and she was so nice. She asked me when I would be in to visit my bike again, which I just died over. How cute is that? That's exactly how *I* think!!

On the say I arrived to get my bike I asked a few more questions about the bike such as whether I could put different tires on and some other features of the bike. Debbie then walked me through and helped me get all the accessories I wanted and needed as well as spent the time really explaining the difference between items and why I needed them. On my final checkout I received 10% off of EVERYTHING. 

With free classes and amazing service, I truly lucked out finding my dream bike at a dream store.

I wasn't looking too much for a new salon when I moved, but after hearing about Snapdragon and passing it several times, I had to give it a try. I clearly remember the day I walked in to discuss an appointment and conveying that I needed someone that was not only good with color, but was okay with non-conventional color. One of the stylists there was actually sad she wasn't available when I was.

When I came in and met Janelle for the first time I knew I was home. She's hilarious and so good at what she does. She's given me the courage and encouragement to add bangs to my look for the first time since I was 8 and to grow my hair longer than I thought would look okay. She's given me recommendations for tattoo artists and we can talk local hangouts and even video games.

The atmosphere was okay. We were at a huge table off to the side due to the large number of people in our party. I quickly noticed that the fans in the building did not cover the one half of our table. We had to fan ourselves with items we could find at the table. We were asked if we wanted separate checks, which was a nice bonus with a large table.

I ended up ordering an omelet, hash browns, and rye toast. The hash browns and the omelet were a little drier than I would've hoped for. I don't like greasetastrophes, but I do like a little flavor. It was, however, a large portion of food, and I ended up only being able to finish half of it.

Here we are a year later, and here I am, disappointed in myself for still lusting after you. And a little awkward that you are still asking our mutual friend to hook us up, when clearly you don't care as much as you say you do.

Sure, our visit starts off hot and heavy, and I usually end up leaving on neutral terms, but the next day I always end up wishing it was more, and I am beginning to lose faith. 

One day you tell me I can order my food without tomatoes and the next day I'm not allowed. Sometimes you forget to bring my wine to my table. Your menu of services usually only offers a couple things tempting enough to try.

I will thank you for finally letting me have cake, but you're still a hit and miss lover and I don't know why you toy with me so.

Okay, yes, I will explain.

I've had several horrible dentist experiences that I don't even want to relive enough to recount here. I've also only ever had two cavity fillings and one root canal my entire life. No braces, no retainer... nothing. Yet every dentist visit I would leave in tears after being told how horrible my teeth are or some other crazy remark that I needed thousands of dollars in additional work done. I'd also leave crying from the pain of having my pretty much perfect teeth cleaned.

Having been in the area a year now, I figured it was time to head to the dentist. I searched and asked everyone for recommendations. It wasn't the distance from my house that mattered as much as the amazing care and treatment I would receive. After reading the other yelp reviews, I headed to Thompson Peak.

From the moment I got in, I was not disappointed. The hygienist I saw, Valerie (I really hope that's right) was amazing. She told me right up front that she could tell it had been awhile but yet I never felt a thing. I've never had such a painless cleaning in my entire life. Honest truth. 

Dr. Dachs was equally as incredible. He was conversational in a good way rather than that awkward what do you say to someone when you're touching their teeth way or that I'm going to ask you a question while you can't talk way. I was told my teeth look good and wasn't left to feel bad for some random reason I won't be able to recall. 

Fantastic fantastic fantastic. I can honestly say I will go back to the dentist in 6 months and probably for the first time in 29 years, not walk in worried and paranoid. I will actually be able to relax."	6	0	1	['yelp', 'definit', 'lead', 'astray', 'came', 'back', 'best', 'dental', 'visit', 'ive', 'entir', 'year', 'exist', 'okay', 'ye', 'explain', 'sever', 'horribl', 'dentist', 'experi', 'dont', 'even', 'want', 'reliv', 'enough', 'recount', 'ive', 'also', 'ever', 'two', 'caviti', 'fill', 'one', 'root', 'canal', 'entir', 'life', 'brace', 'retain', 'noth', 'yet', 'everi', 'dentist', 'visit', 'would', 'leav', 'tear', 'told', 'horribl', 'teeth', 'crazi', 'remark', 'need', 'thousand', 'dollar', 'addit', 'work', 'done', 'id', 'also', 'leav', 'cri', 'pain', 'pretti', 'much', 'perfect', 'teeth', 'cleanedhav', 'area', 'year', 'figur', 'time', 'head', 'dentist', 'search', 'ask', 'everyon', 'recommend', 'wasnt', 'distanc', 'hous', 'matter', 'much', 'amaz', 'care', 'treatment', 'would', 'receiv', 'read', 'yelp', 'review', 'head', 'thompson', 'peakfrom', 'moment', 'got', 'disappoint', 'hygienist', 'saw', 'valeri', 'realli', 'hope', 'that', 'right', 'amaz', 'told', 'right', 'front', 'could', 'tell', 'awhil', 'yet', 'never', 'felt', 'thing', 'ive', 'never', 'painless', 'clean', 'entir', 'life', 'honest', 'truth', 'dr', 'dach', 'equal', 'incred', 'convers', 'good', 'way', 'rather', 'awkward', 'say', 'someon', 'your', 'touch', 'teeth', 'way', 'im', 'go', 'ask', 'question', 'cant', 'talk', 'way', 'told', 'teeth', 'look', 'good', 'wasnt', 'left', 'feel', 'bad', 'random', 'reason', 'wont', 'abl', 'recal', 'fantast', 'fantast', 'fantast', 'honestli', 'say', 'go', 'back', 'dentist', 'month', 'probabl', 'first', 'time', 'year', 'walk', 'worri', 'paranoid', 'actual', 'abl', 'relax']

I was told the house special chicken is the thing to try at China Chili. However, after looking at the menu, and discovering an item by the name of pillow chicken that included the phrase ""pillow shaped morsels"" how could I resist? There was none of that resistance crap. That food was in my belly fast! The pillow chicken was chicken mixed with onion, bamboo shoot and I believe something else and breaded into little pillow sized wonder. It was laid on top of steamed broccoli and then covered in a black pepper sauce. I wish it was spiced with something more than pepper, but other than that I have no complaints. It was so filling (in the good way, not the I'm gonna get sick way like most Chinese I have) I was only able to eat half. 

I loved the huge round tables in the center with the lazy susans. They reminded me of ones at a fantastic restaurant near where I grew up. The inside is really spacious and has some fantastic traditional decor. The menu was so large that I found several things I'd like to try next time including a whole section of chow fun food. Fun? Yep. I'd like some.

Don't be afraid, but don't be surprised either. Keep your cool and order your dogs. Immediately start thinking about if you want fries or rings (onion rings) and be prepared for when you're called upon again. Then watch as your hot dog is mutilated in front of your eyes and what appears on your tray is what looks like a hot mess of decapitated food.

Never fear though... because it is amazing. Well worth the wait and one of the best dogs you'll ever have. My favorites here are the white hot and the bratwurst. Whenever I know I'm going, I end up salivating like Pavlov's dog for hours.

Talk about a million different types of sodas for almost every desire humanly possible. Most of them are not cold and in a few aisles across the store. A select few are cold in the coolers in the back and ready to drink on the spot. I headed straight to the back and decided on one of the ginger beers, which ended up being a great choice. It was just a little over a dollar, and I was asked if I wanted a straw as I paid for it. Um yes, I heart all accessories.... even beverage ones such as straws. 

They have some seats outside in case you want to sit and enjoy some Scottsdale people watching. The staff is very friendly and helpful also.

Yes. There's no liquor license. Yes it's BYOB. Most of the time I don't even bring liquor with me and still have the time of my life. That's how truly phenomenal Hana is. Don't go to get wasted. Go to enjoy your meal. 

The only items I've had here consist of sushi, so if you're looking for recommendations on cooked food, this is not the review for you.

Now. I've come to terms with the fact that I'm a sushi fanatic. It's gone on way too long to just be a phase. The service is great here, the sushi comes out quick, and it will always up the rating of your day by at least 2 points. If you want to get the full effect, sit at the bar.

I've eaten in and ordered out several times and no matter what my food's ready just when it's supposed to be. The nigiri is oh so good. Thinking about it now makes me lean towards Hana tonight. Anyone game? The basic rolls are anything but basic here, all of them made with love.. and fish that want you to enjoy them. 

Sadly I admit I was turned off by the specialty rolls my first visit, because they weren't wrapped very tightly and I didn't look very lady-like while eating them. But I've gotten over that. Sometimes I'm not a lady. And they were delicious. I'll deal with it. You should too.

I found Coup Des Tartes on a whim and decided it was the perfect spot for a girls lunch with some coworkers to just chill without the guys upon my return home. I was right on the money. The place is cozy and inviting and I love the house setting that just makes you want to let you guard down. Right near our table was a photo of a flower girl and ring bearer at a wedding, just like one you'd have hanging in the hallway at your house. Everything was beautiful, right down to the French limonade bottle used for our water at the table. 

I can also honestly say pretty much all the food is good, well at least the appetizers and desserts... we shared a lot of items and never made it to a main course. Here are the items we had (prepare for a long list):

Soup of the Day (Roasted Red Pepper)
Brie Brulee
Chevre \/ Tomate
Three Onion Tarte
Latte with a shot of hazelnut
Banana Brulee
Chocolate Peanut Butter Tarte

I have to say that everything was truly decadent and I wanted to eat 50 more of them. The red pepper soup was the perfect starter and had just the right amount of flavor. The three onion tarte we split and downed within probably a minute or so!! This also came with a side of lettuce with a shallot vinaigrette for an added bonus (yum). I don't like tomatoes so I have to admit I didn't really have the main part of the chevre\/tomate but the cheese and bread it was on was absolutely delicious. And the brie? Yum.... oh the beautiful brie. The carmelized apples on top..mmmmmmmmm an the fruits and bread with it really topped it all off perfectly.

Just when we thought we were all done, we were told about banana brulee and chocolate peanut butter tart. How delicious were both of them. On what we thought were full stomachs, we devoured them whole while I also enjoyed a latte with a shot of hazelnut. It came with a cube of raw sugar and was placed in the most simple yet adorable coffee cup and saucer. 

In the end, the price was well worth it and the staff was amazing and kind. They gave us just the right amount of space and truly let us enjoy ourselves. The pounds my scale added to my weight afterward was well worth it. It just means salad and a run tonight :)

This was also one of the first places I found upon moving to the valley with the help of a flyer I received at an event.  It is quite a drive for me, but *always* worth it.

First things first. The ice cream and sorbets are insanely delicious. No words anyone writes in one of these reviews could possibly accurately describe the goodness of Sweet Republic. However, I would like to quote one of my friends who had their ice cream for the first time at a recent First Friday. After having a couple bites, they looked at me and said, ""Now I know why you drive so far to get this. This is the best ice cream I have ever tasted.""

The atmosphere there is so fun and uplifting. They have outdoor and indoor seating, games to play (including connect four) and free wifi. The mint and orange creamsicle decor has such a refreshing and comforting feel. 

However, one of my favorite aspects to Sweet Republic is being adventurous. I encourage everyone going to have a try of a few different ones there before deciding on what to get. Also, try something you never thought you would. You'll be pleasantly surprised, because not only will it taste exactly like you imagined, but it will be yummy! The owners put a lot of thought and time into their ice cream and I love tasting the new things they've made and hearing their stories about how sometimes it sounds just as crazy to them and ends up being fantastic. 

Sweet Republic is well worth the trip, no matter where you live in the valley. I don't know one person that has gone and been disappointed."	5	4	5	['even', 'start', 'sweet', 'republ', 'also', 'one', 'first', 'place', 'found', 'upon', 'move', 'valley', 'help', 'flyer', 'receiv', 'event', 'quit', 'drive', 'alway', 'worth', 'itfirst', 'thing', 'first', 'ice', 'cream', 'sorbet', 'insan', 'delici', 'word', 'anyon', 'write', 'one', 'review', 'could', 'possibl', 'accur', 'describ', 'good', 'sweet', 'republ', 'howev', 'would', 'like', 'quot', 'one', 'friend', 'ice', 'cream', 'first', 'time', 'recent', 'first', 'friday', 'coupl', 'bite', 'look', 'said', 'know', 'drive', 'far', 'get', 'best', 'ice', 'cream', 'ever', 'tastedth', 'atmospher', 'fun', 'uplift', 'outdoor', 'indoor', 'seat', 'game', 'play', 'includ', 'connect', 'four', 'free', 'wifi', 'mint', 'orang', 'creamsicl', 'decor', 'refresh', 'comfort', 'feel', 'howev', 'one', 'favorit', 'aspect', 'sweet', 'republ', 'adventur', 'encourag', 'everyon', 'go', 'tri', 'differ', 'one', 'decid', 'get', 'also', 'tri', 'someth', 'never', 'thought', 'would', 'youll', 'pleasantli', 'surpris', 'tast', 'exactli', 'like', 'imagin', 'yummi', 'owner', 'put', 'lot', 'thought', 'time', 'ice', 'cream', 'love', 'tast', 'new', 'thing', 'theyv', 'made', 'hear', 'stori', 'sometim', 'sound', 'crazi', 'end', 'fantast', 'sweet', 'republ', 'well', 'worth', 'trip', 'matter', 'live', 'valley', 'dont', 'know', 'one', 'person', 'gone', 'disappoint']

My expectations were not what Compound Grill ended up being, but not really in a bad way, just in that different way. 

The stage first off.. is fantastic, and I love the tables around it - reminds me of music halls I haven't seen in ages. I really wanted to jump on the stage and sing, but someone else was doing that already.. and they were doing it all right! So very right! Great mix of songs from the Beatles to GaGa done by a woman. AMEN SISTA!!!!!

The rest of the place was laid out kinda odd in my opinion, including a set of couches to sit and eat at that were set up around a support post. Around a fire pit, I could see. Around a cute coffee table.. yes. Staring at a post in the ground that doesn't even have art on it or anything, no... and well, as you can probably guess, no one was sitting there that night either. In fact, they were sitting everywhere BUT that spot. 

The service was eh... didn't really seem to willing or wanting.

The menu looked okay, but nothing I was screaming over. We ended up having some chips and salsa that includes a tomatillo\/avacado salsa that I enjoyed :) I also really appreciate the organic hippie vibe that I didn't expect going in. Sexy hippy.. that's what I'm labeling this from now on.

This will probably be the spot I head to in between seeing film events,  because I do really love their music space and the Harkins nearby is where all the film events are, but other than that, it's really too far away and don't have quite enough to lure me back more often."	2	0	1	['meander', 'compound', 'phoenix', 'film', 'fest', 'coupl', 'day', 'ago', 'meet', 'friend', 'drink', 'talk', 'expect', 'compound', 'grill', 'end', 'realli', 'bad', 'way', 'differ', 'way', 'stage', 'first', 'fantast', 'love', 'tabl', 'around', 'remind', 'music', 'hall', 'havent', 'seen', 'age', 'realli', 'want', 'jump', 'stage', 'sing', 'someon', 'els', 'alreadi', 'right', 'right', 'great', 'mix', 'song', 'beatl', 'gaga', 'done', 'woman', 'amen', 'sistath', 'rest', 'place', 'laid', 'kinda', 'odd', 'opinion', 'includ', 'set', 'couch', 'sit', 'eat', 'set', 'around', 'support', 'post', 'around', 'fire', 'pit', 'could', 'see', 'around', 'cute', 'coffe', 'tabl', 'ye', 'stare', 'post', 'ground', 'doesnt', 'even', 'art', 'anyth', 'well', 'probabl', 'guess', 'one', 'sit', 'night', 'either', 'fact', 'sit', 'everywher', 'spot', 'servic', 'eh', 'didnt', 'realli', 'seem', 'will', 'wantingth', 'menu', 'look', 'okay', 'noth', 'scream', 'end', 'chip', 'salsa', 'includ', 'tomatilloavacado', 'salsa', 'enjoy', 'also', 'realli', 'appreci', 'organ', 'hippi', 'vibe', 'didnt', 'expect', 'go', 'sexi', 'hippi', 'that', 'im', 'label', 'onthi', 'probabl', 'spot', 'head', 'see', 'film', 'event', 'realli', 'love', 'music', 'space', 'harkin', 'nearbi', 'film', 'event', 'realli', 'far', 'away', 'dont', 'quit', 'enough', 'lure', 'back', 'often']

Therefore, this breakfast joint is middle of the road. When a friend first mentioned heading here for lunch, I was curious, and after reading reviews. I was scared. But I trust said friend, and allowed myself to be led in blindly to another Two Hippies joint. 

Here are items that were factored into this 3-star rating:

** First and foremost, I didn't love it, but I most certainly didn't hate it either. If someone wanted to go back, I would agree. There are a few more things on the menu that intrigue me enough to want to try them.

** I didn't like the decor as much as their pizza joint. It was too much on the stoner side of hippie.. to a nauseating degree. Then there was this random old stove that didn't scream hippie at all. I personally prefer happy hippie. Oooh now there's an awesome alliteration. And another. BAM!

** The green chile burger I got was pretty damn good. I wish the heat was kicked up a few notches, but it was solid. I was so pleased I nearly swallowed that thing whole.

** They have the lemonade I love. I tried mango this time. Not as good as blood orange, but still solid.

** I did not find the breakfast menu so appealing I wanted it instead of lunch. This was a disappointment. I also heard they don't serve breakfast all day, though one of the people I was dining with did get breakfast. I think we were there around 1pm if I remember correctly.

** The fries were terrible. I love crinkle fries but these were so dry I was unable to enjoy them. Fries aren't supposed to be healthy. Give me the grease. Even adding sauce to them (I tried sriracha) did no good. I will never have fries there again."	0	0	0	['tri', 'let', 'bad', 'press', 'friend', 'huge', 'fan', 'love', 'sway', 'review', 'therefor', 'breakfast', 'joint', 'middl', 'road', 'friend', 'first', 'mention', 'head', 'lunch', 'curiou', 'read', 'review', 'scare', 'trust', 'said', 'friend', 'allow', 'led', 'blindli', 'anoth', 'two', 'hippi', 'joint', 'item', 'factor', 'star', 'rate', 'first', 'foremost', 'didnt', 'love', 'certainli', 'didnt', 'hate', 'either', 'someon', 'want', 'go', 'back', 'would', 'agre', 'thing', 'menu', 'intrigu', 'enough', 'want', 'tri', 'didnt', 'like', 'decor', 'much', 'pizza', 'joint', 'much', 'stoner', 'side', 'hippi', 'nauseat', 'degre', 'random', 'old', 'stove', 'didnt', 'scream', 'hippi', 'person', 'prefer', 'happi', 'hippi', 'oooh', 'there', 'awesom', 'alliter', 'anoth', 'bam', 'green', 'chile', 'burger', 'got', 'pretti', 'damn', 'good', 'wish', 'heat', 'kick', 'notch', 'solid', 'pleas', 'nearli', 'swallow', 'thing', 'whole', 'lemonad', 'love', 'tri', 'mango', 'time', 'good', 'blood', 'orang', 'still', 'solid', 'find', 'breakfast', 'menu', 'appeal', 'want', 'instead', 'lunch', 'disappoint', 'also', 'heard', 'dont', 'serv', 'breakfast', 'day', 'though', 'one', 'peopl', 'dine', 'get', 'breakfast', 'think', 'around', 'pm', 'rememb', 'correctli', 'fri', 'terribl', 'love', 'crinkl', 'fri', 'dri', 'unabl', 'enjoy', 'fri', 'arent', 'suppos', 'healthi', 'give', 'greas', 'even', 'ad', 'sauc', 'tri', 'sriracha', 'good', 'never', 'fri']

They did not disappoint. The take out menu they have is so simple and well organized it's unbelievable. I was told it would be 35 minutes which is reasonable. Imagine my excitement when they arrived in 18!! On top of that my food was very well packaged and organized. 

The garlic chicken isn't as spicy as I was hoping for but was still good and a perfect portion. The wonton soup was delicious too and more than I could eat. The steamed pork dumpling appetizer which is usually fool proof was just okay.

We'll see how many ""after affects"" I have. The big down side I saw so far as the $12 min order. I had to order 3 items for my lowly self and only finished one.

As I've previously stated, I was never going to rush back to kabuki. The first and only trip was enough for me. However, about two months or so ago, I was invited to a lunch for a project I was on, and I hesitantly went. The lunch was back to back with a meeting I had... knowing this, and my issues last time, I arrived a half hour early with another coworker to make sure my order was in. We each ordered three rolls if I remember correctly. After we ordered, the others arrived (please note, it took a half hour to be able to put our order in... even though no one was in the restaurant).

Everyone else began to put theirs in as well and sushi and other ordered items began to arrive. 20 more minutes passed and I soon realized everyone had their food but me. Even those that ordered after. It was now close to my time to leave so I flagged down our server and asked him if I could have my sushi to go. I wasn't extremely hungry, but knew I would be craving something by mid afternoon.

It all went downhill from here. Rather than checking on my order or anything else for that matter, I was attacked and accused of not putting an order down. After all, had it been, it obviously would've been at the table. After 5 minutes of several people ensuring him my order was on a list, I gave up and said to just bring me a philly roll quick so I can not starve myself. One of my coworkers graciously gave up his take home items so I could eat. I was ever thankful.

I left angry and upset...but thanks to friends not completely starving. The food was good, but quickly overlooked by the terrible service I've received both times I've been here. Honestly the food is the only thing that gives them the 2nd star. I bitched on twitter about my disdain and soon had a message from their corporate office. They wanted to call me to discuss the matter with that locale. I told them I didn't really wish to speak with the locale. What's done is done. I wasn't sure what they could honestly say to make me feel better about how I was treated.

Kabuki responded with a rather generous gift card. I decided I would give them one more shot (after all, it was on the house). Honestly I was scared to use it... even with the meal being free, I wasn't sure I could handle the stress of another bad experience. It took me nearly a month to use it.

This past week, I returned and took with me the kind coworker who offered me their take home sushi. We made sure to go on a day where we didn't have any appointments immediately after lunch. We also arrived early. Once again, the place was practically empty. There were only 4 other people there. 

We started off with drinks as we pondered the menu. The drinks my friends, are heavenly. I had a lychee mojito and an apple saketini and practically downed them in one gulp. Filled to the brim, tasteful and beautiful works of art they were. 

We both ordered a few different items. I got two rolls and some nigiri. I was honestly shocked at the relatively ok speed at which they came out. We received our sushi about a half hour after ordering it. Still not super fast, but well, it's better than not getting it at all. The presentation was decent and the sushi was delicious. My ebi nigiri came with a tempura shrimp in the shape of a bunny. That creeped me out a lot. Please don't do that.

In the end, the service is still slow enough and I've had so many bad experiences there, that I would not trust it for lunch. It will never be in my top 5 places to go at any point in time. However, if I end up arriving at Tempe Marketplace 3 hours early for an event, or if someone wants to go to grab a saketini, I will consider it. The only saving grace this establishment has is it's corporate office, a saketini, and decent sushi (once you get it).

There are rumors that my picture may be in the back of the restaurant as a warning for when I come in.... hopefully this is not the reason I had a slight improvement in service."	6	3	3	['long', 'await', 'kabuki', 'updat', 'fair', 'updat', 'combin', 'sever', 'mishap', 'event', 'relat', 'therefor', 'felt', 'need', 'review', 'togeth', 'ive', 'previous', 'state', 'never', 'go', 'rush', 'back', 'kabuki', 'first', 'trip', 'enough', 'howev', 'two', 'month', 'ago', 'invit', 'lunch', 'project', 'hesitantli', 'went', 'lunch', 'back', 'back', 'meet', 'know', 'issu', 'last', 'time', 'arriv', 'half', 'hour', 'earli', 'anoth', 'cowork', 'make', 'sure', 'order', 'order', 'three', 'roll', 'rememb', 'correctli', 'order', 'other', 'arriv', 'pleas', 'note', 'took', 'half', 'hour', 'abl', 'put', 'order', 'even', 'though', 'one', 'restauranteveryon', 'els', 'began', 'put', 'well', 'sushi', 'order', 'item', 'began', 'arriv', 'minut', 'pass', 'soon', 'realiz', 'everyon', 'food', 'even', 'order', 'close', 'time', 'leav', 'flag', 'server', 'ask', 'could', 'sushi', 'go', 'wasnt', 'extrem', 'hungri', 'knew', 'would', 'crave', 'someth', 'mid', 'afternoonit', 'went', 'downhil', 'rather', 'check', 'order', 'anyth', 'els', 'matter', 'attack', 'accus', 'put', 'order', 'obvious', 'wouldv', 'tabl', 'minut', 'sever', 'peopl', 'ensur', 'order', 'list', 'gave', 'said', 'bring', 'philli', 'roll', 'quick', 'starv', 'one', 'cowork', 'gracious', 'gave', 'take', 'home', 'item', 'could', 'eat', 'ever', 'thankfuli', 'left', 'angri', 'upsetbut', 'thank', 'friend', 'complet', 'starv', 'food', 'good', 'quickli', 'overlook', 'terribl', 'servic', 'ive', 'receiv', 'time', 'ive', 'honestli', 'food', 'thing', 'give', 'nd', 'star', 'bitch', 'twitter', 'disdain', 'soon', 'messag', 'corpor', 'offic', 'want', 'call', 'discuss', 'matter', 'local', 'told', 'didnt', 'realli', 'wish', 'speak', 'local', 'what', 'done', 'done', 'wasnt', 'sure', 'could', 'honestli', 'say', 'make', 'feel', 'better', 'treatedkabuki', 'respond', 'rather', 'gener', 'gift', 'card', 'decid', 'would', 'give', 'one', 'shot', 'hous', 'honestli', 'scare', 'use', 'even', 'meal', 'free', 'wasnt', 'sure', 'could', 'handl', 'stress', 'anoth', 'bad', 'experi', 'took', 'nearli', 'month', 'use', 'itthi', 'past', 'week', 'return', 'took', 'kind', 'cowork', 'offer', 'take', 'home', 'sushi', 'made', 'sure', 'go', 'day', 'didnt', 'appoint', 'immedi', 'lunch', 'also', 'arriv', 'earli', 'place', 'practic', 'empti', 'peopl', 'start', 'drink', 'ponder', 'menu', 'drink', 'friend', 'heavenli', 'lyche', 'mojito', 'appl', 'saketini', 'practic', 'down', 'one', 'gulp', 'fill', 'brim', 'tast', 'beauti', 'work', 'art', 'order', 'differ', 'item', 'got', 'two', 'roll', 'nigiri', 'honestli', 'shock', 'rel', 'ok', 'speed', 'came', 'receiv', 'sushi', 'half', 'hour', 'order', 'still', 'super', 'fast', 'well', 'better', 'get', 'present', 'decent', 'sushi', 'delici', 'ebi', 'nigiri', 'came', 'tempura', 'shrimp', 'shape', 'bunni', 'creep', 'lot', 'pleas', 'dont', 'thatin', 'end', 'servic', 'still', 'slow', 'enough', 'ive', 'mani', 'bad', 'experi', 'would', 'trust', 'lunch', 'never', 'top', 'place', 'go', 'point', 'time', 'howev', 'end', 'arriv', 'temp', 'marketplac', 'hour', 'earli', 'event', 'someon', 'want', 'go', 'grab', 'saketini', 'consid', 'save', 'grace', 'establish', 'corpor', 'offic', 'saketini', 'decent', 'sushi', 'get', 'itther', 'rumor', 'pictur', 'may', 'back', 'restaur', 'warn', 'come', 'hope', 'reason', 'slight', 'improv', 'servic']

Which reminds me of my high school days, when the internet was new and I spent an afternoon with a friend visiting websites that also had our name. Most ended up being adult sites, but tonia.com* was an Asian company that had my name written in a fantastic logo. I wonder what it means. 

Anywho, not only does the salad live up to its given name, but Moto is now on my backup sushi rotation. Reasonably priced and of good quality, I was extremely full by the time I ate only half of my dinner. The Tonia salad I actually had for lunch a day later, and was very filling and delicious. I can only imagine what it would've been like eating it the same night. Had it not been as great, I would've never came back and written to the owners, demanding the salad change to a lesser awesome name, maybe one more common or boring.

My to go order was ready exactly when they said it would and I was in and out the door in minutes. I'll be back.

The decor is not only stylish and unique, but pretty much useful. I love the ammo bins on wheels to sent condiments and napkins to the other members of your party. The rest of the interior design is great also. However, I do wonder if women had any input as the chairs have no backs and there are no purse hooks. Which means, my purse goes on the floor or the table. Either one is not appropriate. 

However, the food was amazing. And I'm German. I started off with the basics. A pretzel and cheese. Beer brat.  WITH ROOTBEER ONIONS. And beer. And strudel. And I didn't get hungry again until the next morning (and that was lunch). 

I really appreciated that the food was served on metal trays. It gave a little bit of extra flair. And I give extra points for the way management handled the patrons beside us that started off with a compliment and quickly turned to complaints.

The store has some pretty cute stuff, but it can be pretty overpriced for just adding one embellishment to a plain white pair of  long underwear. I have sucked it up in the past and purchased an old French ammunition bag that had a couple embellishments added onto it and to this day it's one of my favorites and gets tons of comments when I bring it along with me.

They have stuff for men, women, and shoes and housewares as well. Lots of nice vintage sports wear for men, purses and clothes for women, perfumes and body lotions and the like, vintage glasses, bowls and cookware as well as cookbooks. 

But.. it's not just a store. There's also a soda and coffee shop which are vintage and adorable. Every time I've been there though, they've never been open :(

Also, there's a boxing ring. Yes. A real one.

When you made it past the wares you'll find a huge gorgeous antique bar with all the typical drinks as well as the vintage. You can get an Old Fashioned here. A real one. I introduced a friend to Old Fashions for the first time here. He couldn't take them. Ha.

Outside and inside has seating to drink or eat or chit chat and the patio out back has a food truck for the cookin'. You can get sliders, appetizers, breakfast... and nothing I've had is bad.

The owners are pretty well versed in the antiques and very friendly and personable. I ended up happening across it one day while waiting for a table at Oreganos. I wasn't really looking for anything, but just passing the time.

The employees were so nice without being pushy. As luck would have it, I found a bar that we all agreed would look great in my living room. It wasn't antique but it had a great feel and design to it. I asked the woman at the counter for more information and when she saw the piece I was looking at, lit up. Why? Because there's a hilarious story with this bar, and she was dying to share.

When the person who had owned it previously brought it to the store to be sold they informed her, you know, as a heads up, that it didn't make a very good desk.

I wanted to die. I'm totally picturing this lady prancing about a big furniture store not finding ""anything quite right"" and a frustrated sales person answering ""yes"" when she asks if this [bar] will work as a desk. :) And now it's in my living room. 

I also grabbed a great shot glass and holder set that was already on top of it as an accent piece, paid in full that day and was able to leave the bar there for a few days until I could come back and pick it up. They also offer delivery.

The store is very easy to walk through and everything is organized nicely. There is furniture, jewelry, glasses, clocks, portraits.. just everything your little heart desires. They were very helpful when I came to pick up my bar and even helped cover up some of the minor cosmetic flaws that I didn't necessarily care about.

The only issue was that they apparently started to wrap all my shot glasses individually but seemed to have run out of paper. As I got home and was unwrapping them all one by one... I got to the last sheet of paper and to my surprise there were two... but not after one rolled immediately off my counter top and smashed into a bajillion pieces on my tile floor. Not cool folks.

The staff is so knowledgable and extremely helpful; they want nothing more than to see your garden\/farm thrive and for you to have fun doing it. My first experience there, I ended up taking two classes and learned more than I ever thought I'd be able to retain about gardening as I am hardly the green thumb. So there I was, frantically writing it down and hoping I remembered. And a few weeks later, I started to plant various things I'd like to grow in different pots and scattered them about my yard, trying to see what grew where. I had insanely tall zucchini sprouts after only a few days!!! And yes, I know most of you think that's nothing, because it. grows. ANYWHERE. But not for me. I don't keep plants alive. And these lived. And I liked it so much I went back to get advice on how to build a raised garden bed. And I'm now starting to install it. They even offered to test my soil for me. Like I said. Best.

The atmosphere was better than expected. I loved the lighting (or slight lack thereof) and the different booths and tables available. My only complaint was that there happened to be a girl playing piano while we were there, but not knowing this when we arrived, we were seated in an area where we couldn't hear her at all.

The staff was very attentive and I was constantly having my water refilled without even gesturing that I needed it. This was perfect because the heat and spice of the food was exactly what I wanted :)

The unique names of the menu items were fantastic also and I kinda giggled a little bit (and still do). I had an appetizer of Siamese Kisses and a main course titled Evil Jungle Princess.

I think my biggest issue was the layout. It's longer than wider, which isn't really appropriate for a music venue. While we decided to grab bar chairs and move ourselves up in the middle of it, I'm sure people in the bad could not see the band at all. In my opinion, that ruins a small intimate show.

It's almost hard to believe we all ate at the same establishment. 

I made my first visit to My Florist for a fabulous #smunch breakfast with friends. I had never been but had looked at their website and just loved the story of the restaurant. Someplace with character, that's more than a building definitely gets my attention. The photos on the website also do not do this place justice. Every time my gaze wandered around various parts of My Florist I was continually floored. It's so beautiful and such a great conversation piece. When our huge group was seated we lucked out and got what I like to refer to as the king's table. The chairs were so exquisite to look at and even more comfortable than they appeared. I just sank into them and hit an instant pre food happy coma. Everyone seems to have issues with the piano, but I kinda wished they were playing. I almost went and started playing myself. 

As far as the food, I have mixed feelings. I started off with a mimosa which was excellent and very reasonably priced. I then had wanted the frittata but they were pre-made and I was unable to have it without tomato. I am not a fan of pre-made... or tomato. Having to make a last minute decision I went with my staple, an omelet. I had Gruyere, chicken, and mushroom and a side of Nutella for my toast. I also ordered a limosa.

The omelet was okay but not outstanding and a little pricey. However, I immensely enjoyed the toast. Non ordinary toast makes me happy. The side of Nutella was a little pricey in my opinion, but was huge. I was able to use gobs for both my pieces of toast and someone else's. I think the eggs benedict that a few got looked tasty and I'd go again to try that. The salad menu also looked delightful. The limosa? Delicious.

As far as service goes, I didn't have any issues. Our waitress was knowledgeable and friendly and didn't mind our crazy large party of nearly 12. Our food all arrived at nearly the same time and within a reasonable amount of time. She also was nice enough to split our checks the exact way we wished. Can't beat that."	3	1	1	['admit', 'read', 'vast', 'rang', 'review', 'florist', 'made', 'debat', 'give', 'inconsist', 'decid', 'give', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'round', 'almost', 'hard', 'believ', 'ate', 'establish', 'made', 'first', 'visit', 'florist', 'fabul', 'smunch', 'breakfast', 'friend', 'never', 'look', 'websit', 'love', 'stori', 'restaur', 'someplac', 'charact', 'that', 'build', 'definit', 'get', 'attent', 'photo', 'websit', 'also', 'place', 'justic', 'everi', 'time', 'gaze', 'wander', 'around', 'variou', 'part', 'florist', 'continu', 'floor', 'beauti', 'great', 'convers', 'piec', 'huge', 'group', 'seat', 'luck', 'got', 'like', 'refer', 'king', 'tabl', 'chair', 'exquisit', 'look', 'even', 'comfort', 'appear', 'sank', 'hit', 'instant', 'pre', 'food', 'happi', 'coma', 'everyon', 'seem', 'issu', 'piano', 'kinda', 'wish', 'play', 'almost', 'went', 'start', 'play', 'far', 'food', 'mix', 'feel', 'start', 'mimosa', 'excel', 'reason', 'price', 'want', 'frittata', 'premad', 'unabl', 'without', 'tomato', 'fan', 'premad', 'tomato', 'make', 'last', 'minut', 'decis', 'went', 'stapl', 'omelet', 'gruyer', 'chicken', 'mushroom', 'side', 'nutella', 'toast', 'also', 'order', 'limosath', 'omelet', 'okay', 'outstand', 'littl', 'pricey', 'howev', 'immens', 'enjoy', 'toast', 'non', 'ordinari', 'toast', 'make', 'happi', 'side', 'nutella', 'littl', 'pricey', 'opinion', 'huge', 'abl', 'use', 'gob', 'piec', 'toast', 'someon', 'els', 'think', 'egg', 'benedict', 'got', 'look', 'tasti', 'id', 'go', 'tri', 'salad', 'menu', 'also', 'look', 'delight', 'limosa', 'deliciousa', 'far', 'servic', 'goe', 'didnt', 'issu', 'waitress', 'knowledg', 'friendli', 'didnt', 'mind', 'crazi', 'larg', 'parti', 'nearli', 'food', 'arriv', 'nearli', 'time', 'within', 'reason', 'amount', 'time', 'also', 'nice', 'enough', 'split', 'check', 'exact', 'way', 'wish', 'cant', 'beat']

I've ventured into nearly all of the menu by now, and all of the items I want to try. When there's a lot of different things on the menu that interest my tummy, that's a good thing. Don't lose that part of you.

What's my favorite so far? Probably the fondue for an appetizer and the windsor burger (no tomato) and church potatoes for dinner. That seems to be the popular choice I make 80% of the time.

So.  What about the other 20%? BRUNCH BITCHES. Yes. There's brunch now as if this place couldn't get any better. Lovely, delicious, amazing brunch. Brunch with $5 pitchers of drinks. Brunches with some of the best biscuits I've ever had with my biscuits and gravy. Brunches that left the large group of people I came with amazed and full. 

The service is usually right on point. The food is always incredible. The decor I cannot seem to get enough of, and even though I am not a fan of having to valet, you make it complimentary. And the valet people are pretty cool. Is it sad that I'm nearly on a first name basis with them as well?

I beg you to stay, Windsor.

It looked very well packaged but that's about where the experience stops being fantastic.

I love my spice... don't get me wrong. I usually order my Thai on the high end of the spice scale. Spice is a great way to get a flavorful dish. It also can reveal the caliber of the place you are ordering from. Typically a take out Chinese establishment is not going to offer a scale for their spice. It's not a Thai restaurant. They simply indicate with a little pepper when something is going to be spicy.

My dish which was a scallop dish was very overpowering on the spice end, and not in a good way. The spice completely overpowered my food and any good flavor that could've resulted. 

I may try it again and order a non spicy dish to see how that ends up, but for now, it's out of rotation on my take out list."	2	1	1	['im', 'realli', 'fan', 'say', 'realli', 'excit', 'food', 'arriv', 'minut', 'like', 'realli', 'excit', 'that', 'jimmi', 'john', 'deliveri', 'quick', 'look', 'well', 'packag', 'that', 'experi', 'stop', 'fantastici', 'love', 'spice', 'dont', 'get', 'wrong', 'usual', 'order', 'thai', 'high', 'end', 'spice', 'scale', 'spice', 'great', 'way', 'get', 'flavor', 'dish', 'also', 'reveal', 'calib', 'place', 'order', 'typic', 'take', 'chines', 'establish', 'go', 'offer', 'scale', 'spice', 'thai', 'restaur', 'simpli', 'indic', 'littl', 'pepper', 'someth', 'go', 'spicymi', 'dish', 'scallop', 'dish', 'overpow', 'spice', 'end', 'good', 'way', 'spice', 'complet', 'overpow', 'food', 'good', 'flavor', 'couldv', 'result', 'may', 'tri', 'order', 'non', 'spici', 'dish', 'see', 'end', 'rotat', 'take', 'list']

Not as many items as dog items, and some work definitely still needs to be done in the way of cute cat items, but I did find some pure gems. The first were some pretty healthy treats that they always seem to devour. The second were these lovely felt pieces to be used as toys on tile and hardwood floors. I also think they were laced with catnip. Holy bat shit batman!! Those little toys spun so fast across the house that Bic and Sharpie didn't know what to do. They were going crazy. It is so awesome to see them get so much delight and challenge out of such a simple toy. This is usually one of the first local stores I head to for new kitten gear. After that, I resort to looking online.	3	1	2	['one', 'day', 'wander', 'nobl', 'beast', 'discov', 'okay', 'select', 'item', 'mitten', 'kitten', 'bic', 'sharpi', 'mani', 'item', 'dog', 'item', 'work', 'definit', 'still', 'need', 'done', 'way', 'cute', 'cat', 'item', 'find', 'pure', 'gem', 'first', 'pretti', 'healthi', 'treat', 'alway', 'seem', 'devour', 'second', 'love', 'felt', 'piec', 'use', 'toy', 'tile', 'hardwood', 'floor', 'also', 'think', 'lace', 'catnip', 'holi', 'bat', 'shit', 'batman', 'littl', 'toy', 'spun', 'fast', 'across', 'hous', 'bic', 'sharpi', 'didnt', 'know', 'go', 'crazi', 'awesom', 'see', 'get', 'much', 'delight', 'challeng', 'simpl', 'toy', 'usual', 'one', 'first', 'local', 'store', 'head', 'new', 'kitten', 'gear', 'resort', 'look', 'onlin']

In yet another episode of My Impulsive Life, I was working on rearranging a room and decided to repurpose an old bookshelf as my new storage unit for my bags and hats. When all was finished I decided it needed something more. Fabric as some type of cover and a little bit of class. But I couldn't find anything open nearby and those that were had some really piss poor excuses for fabric collections.

I posted on facebook about my frustration and get a response to try 35th Ave Sew and Vac. I didn't hesitate as I was desperate and in the mood to shop. Having one of the cross streets in the name is a huge help too, let me tell ya. I found the place easily and was excited to get started in my search.

At first it looked like there was a very limited selection of fabric and I started to weep (on the inside, don't worry). Then a skinny hallway and narrow beacon of light directed me to the mecca of fabric. I was lost in no time, wandering about the rows and admiring the selections. They were categorized beautifully and the taxonomy\/library science geek in me swooned. Everything was so easy to find.

Finally I made a decision and headed to the checkout. They were so nice and friendly and it was a breeze to pay and make my way home to use my newly found goods. Everyone I encountered seemed really knowledgeable and courteous, which is nice, because I actually don't know a damn thing about sewing except that I can't do it."	3	1	2	['hear', 'angel', 'sing', 'yet', 'anoth', 'episod', 'impuls', 'life', 'work', 'rearrang', 'room', 'decid', 'repurpos', 'old', 'bookshelf', 'new', 'storag', 'unit', 'bag', 'hat', 'finish', 'decid', 'need', 'someth', 'fabric', 'type', 'cover', 'littl', 'bit', 'class', 'couldnt', 'find', 'anyth', 'open', 'nearbi', 'realli', 'piss', 'poor', 'excus', 'fabric', 'collectionsi', 'post', 'facebook', 'frustrat', 'get', 'respons', 'tri', 'th', 'ave', 'sew', 'vac', 'didnt', 'hesit', 'desper', 'mood', 'shop', 'one', 'cross', 'street', 'name', 'huge', 'help', 'let', 'tell', 'ya', 'found', 'place', 'easili', 'excit', 'get', 'start', 'searchat', 'first', 'look', 'like', 'limit', 'select', 'fabric', 'start', 'weep', 'insid', 'dont', 'worri', 'skinni', 'hallway', 'narrow', 'beacon', 'light', 'direct', 'mecca', 'fabric', 'lost', 'time', 'wander', 'row', 'admir', 'select', 'categor', 'beauti', 'taxonomylibrari', 'scienc', 'geek', 'swoon', 'everyth', 'easi', 'findfin', 'made', 'decis', 'head', 'checkout', 'nice', 'friendli', 'breez', 'pay', 'make', 'way', 'home', 'use', 'newli', 'found', 'good', 'everyon', 'encount', 'seem', 'realli', 'knowledg', 'courteou', 'nice', 'actual', 'dont', 'know', 'damn', 'thing', 'sew', 'except', 'cant']

I didn't mind the wait, as that's typical during weekend brunch. I especially loved that we were lucky enough to get a table on the outside of the layout so that I could keep my bike near me while we ate. Unfortunately, there is no good way to lock your bike up while on the property from what I could see. And this isn't just because I'm overprotective about my bike (though we all know I am).

The service was fairly good. Our sever kindly answered all our questions and dealt with our crazy bill splitting. Our meals came out in a reasonable amount of time and all at the same time too :)

On recommendation of the server, my debate between the spinach mushroom omelet and the eggs Benedict ended with the Benedict. I probably would've rather had the omelet or some a la carte items. For some reason the eggs Benedict just seemed overly spiced to me, and I love spice. The home fries didn't look or taste right either, though I've seen pictures of them looking delicious :-\/

As far as beverages go, the revolution individual herbal teas are the awesome. I didn't even know revolution made those. LOVE. Also loved the way my friend's mimosa came, with a small carafe of orange juice and a tiny bottle of sparkling wine. Individual sized things are also the awesome.

One other small note... crayons for the tables would be awesome if you always use the white paper as a tablecloth!!

When the light rail opened I rarely rode it at first. The hours sucked and the last thing I wanted was to end up stranded in Phoenix because I refused to leave by 11pm. 

Now the weekend hours at least have changed, and while sometimes it still sucks (house parties don't always end at 2am), I mostly like it. I've found myself taking the light rail even more now that I am back from a stint overseas and hating driving my car. In the past week, I've used it four times to make trips downtown for some fun and mischief. 

Unfortunately I am only able to use the light rail for recreational reasons as I work in Snottsdale, and they, apparently, aren't fans of the light rail. My only hope is to have it hit farther in Tempe or Mesa that I can take my bike and ride a few miles in after a stop... but I don't think that will happen either. I know that's not really the LR's fault, but it still makes me bitter.

The adventures are fun on the LR and it's actually helped this newby that's terribly unblessed with being navigationally challenged on top of it to navigate the Phoenix area, downtown in particular.

It was a few miles from my house and down an old back road, smack dab in the middle of gorgeous scenery. There is a very large indoor area to sit as well as a large outdoor area as well, and a pond and vineyard on site.

It well beat out the bar scene for several reasons. First off was that you could bring in your own dinner and enjoy a bottle of wine and dinner with friends. For this reason, it ended up being the location for several of my birthday parties. 15 of us or so would grab a table, bring some delicious tapas, someone would bring a cake, and we'd have several bottles of wine and still be able to have a conversation. Being on a back road it was easy to get home and there was never traffic. They had board games available also and snack plates of their own.

Their wine is incredible. I remember the day I had my first taste of their Red Kiss. At the time it wasn't even being bottled and was only available in house. They bottled it a few months later, at Thanksgiving and I gave it to many friends and family members as presents. The perfect combination of chocolate and red wine (neither of which I like separately) was irresistible. Their ice wine is to die for, and I love their party wine with the crazy gnome on the label. 

I also cannot forget the owners which are incredible. They were so friendly every tine I came in or called in regards to something and always gave my friends and I excellent service whenever we arrived. 

If you are in the area, this is not something you can pass up."	4	3	2	['hand', 'favorit', 'hangout', 'live', 'akron', 'mile', 'hous', 'old', 'back', 'road', 'smack', 'dab', 'middl', 'gorgeou', 'sceneri', 'larg', 'indoor', 'area', 'sit', 'well', 'larg', 'outdoor', 'area', 'well', 'pond', 'vineyard', 'siteit', 'well', 'beat', 'bar', 'scene', 'sever', 'reason', 'first', 'could', 'bring', 'dinner', 'enjoy', 'bottl', 'wine', 'dinner', 'friend', 'reason', 'end', 'locat', 'sever', 'birthday', 'parti', 'us', 'would', 'grab', 'tabl', 'bring', 'delici', 'tapa', 'someon', 'would', 'bring', 'cake', 'wed', 'sever', 'bottl', 'wine', 'still', 'abl', 'convers', 'back', 'road', 'easi', 'get', 'home', 'never', 'traffic', 'board', 'game', 'avail', 'also', 'snack', 'plate', 'owntheir', 'wine', 'incred', 'rememb', 'day', 'first', 'tast', 'red', 'kiss', 'time', 'wasnt', 'even', 'bottl', 'avail', 'hous', 'bottl', 'month', 'later', 'thanksgiv', 'gave', 'mani', 'friend', 'famili', 'member', 'present', 'perfect', 'combin', 'chocol', 'red', 'wine', 'neither', 'like', 'separ', 'irresist', 'ice', 'wine', 'die', 'love', 'parti', 'wine', 'crazi', 'gnome', 'label', 'also', 'cannot', 'forget', 'owner', 'incred', 'friendli', 'everi', 'tine', 'came', 'call', 'regard', 'someth', 'alway', 'gave', 'friend', 'excel', 'servic', 'whenev', 'arriv', 'area', 'someth', 'pass']

Now that I have that off my chest I have to say I'm confused. Why? Because, according to yelp, the Mazda dealership near 16th St & Camelback brands its service department under a completely different name. But I have never experience that in my contact with them or mailings I receive. It's always been Camelback Mazda. Alas, I am getting service, so I guess this is the company I need to file it under.

After being here a few times, I have to say it's pretty much so-so. The first time I was here, I had an amazing experience with the service department. Iain was fantastic and told me what was up and showed me what was going on. I hate when mechanics and service staff just assume I'm gonna throw money at them without understanding the issue. It's crazy. He also gave me a loaner car when it was going to be longer than expected, which I truly appreciate. Granted it was a horrid orange Subaru wagon\/SUV thing that was SO not my Mazda, but it worked.

This time, I'm a little less optimistic. The time it took me to even get my car into service was a nightmare. I sat there while some typing was going on and questions were asked that should've been in my record and on my appointment (like WTF I'm getting done). Other Mazda dealerships I've been to have had that ready when I got there. I just review sign, and go hop to my coworking. The end. Get with it. It took 15 minutes for my car to even get back there. Maybe I should get here 20 minutes early next time. 

However, the lobby if you need to wait is fantastic. I always choose to sit and wait because it gives me time to catch up on things, like yelp reviews. There's a TV, some couches, high tables to sit and work at, wifi, popcorn, coffee, soda, and slushies. Oh and this great photo wall of people kayaking. I uploaded it so you don't miss out.

Overall not too bad, but time will tell how consistent the check-in procedure is."	1	1	1	['review', 'occasion', 'brought', 'showcas', 'mazda', 'servic', 'lobbi', 'wifi', 'kinda', 'took', 'minut', 'work', 'seem', 'okay', 'hope', 'get', 'thisnow', 'chest', 'say', 'im', 'confus', 'accord', 'yelp', 'mazda', 'dealership', 'near', 'th', 'st', 'camelback', 'brand', 'servic', 'depart', 'complet', 'differ', 'name', 'never', 'experi', 'contact', 'mail', 'receiv', 'alway', 'camelback', 'mazda', 'ala', 'get', 'servic', 'guess', 'compani', 'need', 'file', 'underaft', 'time', 'say', 'pretti', 'much', 'soso', 'first', 'time', 'amaz', 'experi', 'servic', 'depart', 'iain', 'fantast', 'told', 'show', 'go', 'hate', 'mechan', 'servic', 'staff', 'assum', 'im', 'gonna', 'throw', 'money', 'without', 'understand', 'issu', 'crazi', 'also', 'gave', 'loaner', 'car', 'go', 'longer', 'expect', 'truli', 'appreci', 'grant', 'horrid', 'orang', 'subaru', 'wagonsuv', 'thing', 'mazda', 'workedthi', 'time', 'im', 'littl', 'less', 'optimist', 'time', 'took', 'even', 'get', 'car', 'servic', 'nightmar', 'sat', 'type', 'go', 'question', 'ask', 'shouldv', 'record', 'appoint', 'like', 'wtf', 'im', 'get', 'done', 'mazda', 'dealership', 'ive', 'readi', 'got', 'review', 'sign', 'go', 'hop', 'cowork', 'end', 'get', 'took', 'minut', 'car', 'even', 'get', 'back', 'mayb', 'get', 'minut', 'earli', 'next', 'time', 'howev', 'lobbi', 'need', 'wait', 'fantast', 'alway', 'choos', 'sit', 'wait', 'give', 'time', 'catch', 'thing', 'like', 'yelp', 'review', 'there', 'tv', 'couch', 'high', 'tabl', 'sit', 'work', 'wifi', 'popcorn', 'coffe', 'soda', 'slushi', 'oh', 'great', 'photo', 'wall', 'peopl', 'kayak', 'upload', 'dont', 'miss', 'outoveral', 'bad', 'time', 'tell', 'consist', 'checkin', 'procedur']

I have my coffee, my hair salon, my cute boutique shop, my dive bar, my Fresh and Easy, and then they had to add a Wal-Mart. A little part of me died the day I saw the coming soon sign. A little part of me dies every time I see the building and I have to admit I don't cross the intersection of Southern and Rural much anymore.

However, as chance would have it, I was looking for a very specific item this weekend and the only place I knew that carried it (as the model I found first was about to be discontinued) was at Wal-Mart. So, I put on my best pair of loungewear meets dancewear and forced myself in. The store is small (thank God) and is not a large vastly sized super jungle. 

I first attempted to search for the item, and had no success. I then headed to customer service to see if they could check and see if another store had the item. I gave them the information that is listed on the company website to use and was given back a blank stare. Apparently the information listed on the website for the online store items cannot be used to look up inventory?????

However, I'm not that impressed by the rolls... not sure what it's been the past two times, but they seem not up to par with what I remember and not quite as worth the cost as I thought. It could be that most of them are too fancy and lack the mix of sophistication and simplicity that I look for when I am out for sushi.

I took a friend that was visiting from out of town here on a whim as it looked cute to her when we drove past (and didn't have a line). I was not disappointed. We were seated right away in a lovely area outside. The style and decor of the restaurant is gorgeous. The women's restroom was stunning. The staff was also accommodating.

I started off with a fabulous mimosa-esqe concoction that completely hit the spot. Our food came out in a flash. In fact, it was before I'd even finished my first mimosa. 

I had ordered bananas foster french toast. That sounds good doesn't it? Let me tell you it was simply heavenly. The presentation was exquisite and it wasn't so rich that I couldn't eat it. It was also the perfect breakfast portion (just enough that you can finish it because leftover breakfast doesn't always turn out well). I have never had such an amazing order of french toast in my life. I left still craving more.

As soon as I head over to pick it up, it starts pouring. I mean like there was a tornado warning later that night pouring storm. I was half tempted to cancel my order and get delivery but I'm glad I didn't. By the time I arrive it's so bad that in the 40 seconds it took me to run in from across the street I was completely soaked. When I walked in, the establishment was close to empty and everyone stopped and stared at me like an awkward episode of a movie.

The owner? Super nice. She let us know what was in the store, how it was laid out, sales going on, and was very helpful. The dog Blueberry is about as adorable and friendly as they get and was very good at helping me find just what I was looking for.

I can't begin to describe how much easier travel is with the Sky Train. I've never waited more than 5 minutes for a train and if I get there early enough I can even pre-check my bags. The issue is, I'm never there early enough, even if I'm there 90 minutes before as it states. The station is clean, the walkways are awesome and it drops you off right near all the concourses at terminal 4.

First off, the beer is fantastic. I love several of their brews, specifically the Peach Ale and Hop Knot. If there's a seasonal out at the time, try it. Even if it's not your style, you will appreciate how well crafted it is. 

The food is never bad. Never. I've had pizza, beer bread, burgers, appetizers, and wings and they have never let me down. It's probably some of the best pub food I've ever had. The fries are to die for. If you want a great appetizer for a group, go for the spinach dip. I swear the dish it comes in never goes empty and I'm not really joking. I once ordered one as my dinner, quickly became full and offered some to about 12 friends and we only were able to finish half. 

The place is insanely huge too. Lots of different areas to sit depending on your mood and all of them are great spots. I prefer the little covered patio area off to the side the best.

Just go. Every bad review you've read has been wrong.

Unabridged:
I was worried. Afraid. Scared of heading to Big Earl's after the reviews I read that it just wasn't up to par. I'm so glad didn't listen and went anyway.

I guess I'm glad I walked in the side entrance because I didn't see the big display of tshirts Martin mentioned in his New Times review. Or they just aren't as out there. Or I was just really craving food. Either way, now that I'm thinking of Martin, I wonder if he knows he's on a big framed banned poster hanging up at Big Earl's.

The place could benefit from some decor change, but I honestly think it's still that way for the mere fact that it's in old town. I bet those business buildings have HOAs. Tuscan\/crap\/southwestern style or die....

But. I digress...

Usually when I see lunch menu options at a BBQ place I tend to want to skip them b\/c I think they're going to be ruined 'by the bun"" and just a small icky amount of what I want to enjoy. Looking at the prices and sizes of the lunch and dinner menu though, I could tell Big Earl's was some serious shit. Serious. It was hard to make a choice. They have desserts with chocolate whip people... chocolate whip. I almost avoided real lunch food altogether. They have a leg of beast feast... folks.. if you got this for carry out, I'm not sure how it would fit in your car. But I can guarantee you'd eat it all. 

So what did I get?

The Kentucky Mule is bourbon and ginger beer. And it was perfect. 

I was the only one in my group to ever have fried pickles before, and I was curious as to if they were as bad as mentioned before, so I ordered them. They were PERFECT. I have yet to see fried pickles done as well in this area as they are at Earl's. I have turned several people into fried pickle enthusiasts!!

Then I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and mac & cheese. And I was full. This was the largest lunch I've ever seen. The bun at first looks like a cheap attempt at a bun, but it compliments the pork perfectly. Their sweet & spicy sauce is my favorite and the mac & cheese was to die for.

As we finished, Tony, who cooks and created the sauces, came over to our table to give us a chance to let him know what he can fix. One of my table guests sarcastically complained about the mac & cheese he devoured. The result? We were brought out another side of deep fried mac & cheese. HOLY HELL!!

Especially after visiting another Thai restaurant in the area last night and realizing it doesn't even come close in comparison. 

From what I recall, the spice I recall from earlier visits was good but nothing spectacular and the dessert was fabulous. Since then, I've been a crazy regular at Thai Rama and it never fails, I'm craving their Thai specifically at least once a week. Usually for yellow chicken curry.

The prices are very reasonable and the dinner portion is enough to last me at least two meals. AT LEAST. The curry containers are a really sturdy plastic, which means they not only stay safe on the drive home, but they are reusable and recyclable.

And the heat people. Wow. Let me tell you, that it's on point. And then some. The heat is perfect. I am pretty tolerant, and love, a good amount of heat in my food. And medium here is usually the most I can handle. Any more, and I'm buying a gallon of milk for the meal too.

To Go orders are pretty quick, which is convenient and the staff is so friendly. I'm always offered water and a seat while I'm waiting.

1) A bar that actually looks good in the daytime. The flooring was beautiful and the fabric on the chairs complemented. It was very clean.
2) Every NFL game was being shown on Sunday, including the Packers\/Lions. They were even all labeled and the waitress knew exactly where each one was being shown.
3) A hard to pick just one breakfast menu. I ended up choosing the bananas foster pancakes but bird in the hole needs to be tried. 

These are enough that I will probably come back at least another time, just to try the other fantastic breakfast item.. maybe dinner (which looked equally pleasing). However, there are some annoyances to be dealt with:

1) The packers\/lions game was being played on the patio, which was nice. However, the sound we were receiving was from another game and was annoying.
2) The service was a little slow. Our server would frequently come out and not check on us. I almost missed the breakfast cut off time because of this. However, she did offer to split our check which was well appreciated. 
3) The mimosa was huge but not very mimosa-y.

My first few experiences with South Mountain brought the user experience professional in me out as I actually wanted to attempt to hike a specific trail. Instead, all that happened was horrendously marked trails that left me wandering miles in the wrong direction. 

Was it necessarily that bad? No. Most of the time, I don't care which trail I am on or am not on. The girl scout in me isn't too bad at finding my way home and I love random unplanned adventures. However, there are times where I am out to conquer a specific trail and then this problem is highly relevant and makes me swear so loudly I think the bobcats may think it an invitation to come out and play.

All in all it's a win. I've taken many the afternoon, morning, or all day suited with some water, sunglasses, and my hiking shoes and some granola bars and hit the trails either for a casual hike with friends or a serious full out trek. Sometimes I'm not only stupid enough to run up one small summit that was way farther than it seemed, but I'm stupid enough to do it twice.

I've tried to order a different sandwich every time and every time it's been just as amazing as the last, if not better.

I love how the line goes through the store, allowing you to see all the wines, beer options, foods you can buy and the deli section in slow motion before you make it to the counter. Next time I am definitely getting the German potato salad!

Two minor issues I had with eating in last time:
1)  One of the displayed beers, a microbrew I look forward to every year, wasn't actually available.
2) Upon going up to the counter to get a refill on my beverage the man taking orders was very upset. He told me the people in the line were gonna come after me. And I'll stop there.

Biking up and down the hills can really give you a run for your money without even realizing it.. until it's too late :) Not that I know this from experience. I definitely don't give up.

There are plenty of shelters and picnic areas that you can use if open or reserve. I always see birthday parties and events going on while I'm there. Another common sighting is people watching and feeding the ducks. I always stop to see the babies.

There's so much to offer from basketball courts to green areas, playgrounds and picnic shelters. One of the activities I keep wanting to do but never remember is take a trip on the peddle boats. Someone remind me in a few weeks to do this. Or fall :)

Most of the weekend days bring some type of festival or event that makes the park too crowded for me.

I ended up there on the last day of Yelp Eats with a group of friends in a craving for Italian. From what I saw on their menu, I was very excited to see what was i store for me and had heard pretty decent things. I walked out not that excited. 

The ambiance inside is very nice, though a bit on the dark side. The decor inside told a completely different story than what I was thinking when I saw the entrance. It is very posh inside and I did like the comfy booths.

We arrived early enough to get the early bird special, which appeared to be a better deal than the yelp eats one. I wonder if this was truly our best choice. 

For me when it comes to pasta, I am a bit picky. This mainly comes from the fact that I don't like really heavy sauces and I really do not like tomatoes. It has to be a good Italian place and not your run of the mill to get me excited.

My first course was a Caesar salad. Wait take that back. That was supposed to be my first course. I believe I really got romaine lettuce, croutons and dressing of the day. It definitely was *not* Caesar. This left me sad. The bread with it though was pretty damn good although I suggest bigger bottles of balsamic. We ran out fast! 

My main course was chicken marsala and a side of penne. The penne came with a paste (note I did not say sauce) and seemed a little dry and bland. The chicken marsala was actually decent but pretty run of the mill and nothing spectacular. 

Dessert involved two mini cannolis. Like the pasta, they seemed a little dry and lacking, but were flavorful. 

Overall my meal was really just okay.

And where I meet up for coffee on weekends and evenings with friends. When you can find parking (though I prefer walking or biking), the atmosphere there is so relaxed you can't help but sit and unwind for a few.

Their non-coffee items are just as delicious, from the italian sodas (with choice of regular or heavy cream) to the delicious desserts and baked goods (which usually even have a vegan option), keep me coming back.

What do you go here for? People watching. Relaxing. Chatting with some friends. Chatting with some random strangers. Having a brew while you're at it. 

All of these things I can do at Coach House. All of these things I love doing at Coach House.

Outdoors is by far my favorite place to sit. I feel here is where people watching is at its finest and the true dive bar comes out. It's also where the bouncers have been when I've came by at night... and they have some awesome stories to share themselves. 

Sure you will smell cigarettes. Sure your heels may stick to the screwdriver and PBR laced floor. But why are you wearing heels to begin with?

I stalked it clear back when it was first announced... and when only digital renderings were available... when I kept wanting to visit but it was a drive...

And then it happened. I had the opportunity to go and I was so excited. I examined the exhibits one more time online. And arrived before my date to take in the outside. It's beautiful. The whole building is absolutely beautiful. The outside courtyard. The contours and lines of the inside.

Nearly every exhibit has a sample of the music and dance of the region\/country and so they aren't all interfering with each other, they give you headsets to wear during the tour. Usually I pass on these, but this wasn't additional information, it was part of the exhibit. So I walked around, looking like a doofus but geeking out on music.

The museum has a lot of stuff. A lot. Nearly every country is represented. Countries most don't normally associate with having their own music, such as Afghanistan. It was amazing to see the differences and the similarities in the instruments. The low fidelity versus the highly detailed, each works of art in their own way. My mind wandered and I daydreamed as I explored. One thing I realized is while all countries have something in common typically (same types of instruments), the US is seriously lacking in things that rattle.. bracelets, skirts, headdresses, etc... I call for more rattling in our instruments.

Some other interesting things I found were a hot pink star guitar, that made me want to try to play the guitar again, tiny instruments, and a Victory Piano, which I've never seen up close and in person until this trip. And the piano rooms... and organ rooms... oh sweet heaven. Good thing they had lots of security.. because I was SO TEMPTED to sit and play. I wanted to play all those pianos so badly.  They do have some rooms where you can try and do some hands on stuff.. but it's never the same as the works of art that are for display only.

Towards the end, the museum was closing and I found it hard to take time to see the rest... and I'd already spent 3 hours there...I probably needed another hour or so.

I'm sure this space is going to be great for concerts and I really enjoyed my trip. So why the sad 3 stars? Two main reasons:

1) It's supposed to be a museum, which to me is something you can enjoy time and time again. As of now, it doesn't look like they have any rotating or special exhibits, which will make it hard to justify a return.

2) The navigation is horrible. There are multiple entrances to each region, but only one is the ""right one"" that allows you to navigate in a normal pattern. However, you have no guides with signage or anything on which is the preferred entrance (though I beg to ask why is there more than one if one leads you in an unnatural pattern). They put so much time, money and effort into this museum.. I really wish they had hired some UX folk. If they did, I wish they were better.

It's worth a visit.. honestly. Especially if you are a music geek like myself. I'm just not sure it's worth more than that."	1	0	2	['nearli', 'imposs', 'explain', 'much', 'want', 'expect', 'fall', 'love', 'mim', 'stalk', 'clear', 'back', 'first', 'announc', 'digit', 'render', 'avail', 'kept', 'want', 'visit', 'driveand', 'happen', 'opportun', 'go', 'excit', 'examin', 'exhibit', 'one', 'time', 'onlin', 'arriv', 'date', 'take', 'outsid', 'beauti', 'whole', 'build', 'absolut', 'beauti', 'outsid', 'courtyard', 'contour', 'line', 'insidenearli', 'everi', 'exhibit', 'sampl', 'music', 'danc', 'regioncountri', 'arent', 'interf', 'give', 'headset', 'wear', 'tour', 'usual', 'pass', 'wasnt', 'addit', 'inform', 'part', 'exhibit', 'walk', 'around', 'look', 'like', 'doofu', 'geek', 'musicth', 'museum', 'lot', 'stuff', 'lot', 'nearli', 'everi', 'countri', 'repres', 'countri', 'dont', 'normal', 'associ', 'music', 'afghanistan', 'amaz', 'see', 'differ', 'similar', 'instrument', 'low', 'fidel', 'versu', 'highli', 'detail', 'work', 'art', 'way', 'mind', 'wander', 'daydream', 'explor', 'one', 'thing', 'realiz', 'countri', 'someth', 'common', 'typic', 'type', 'instrument', 'us', 'serious', 'lack', 'thing', 'rattl', 'bracelet', 'skirt', 'headdress', 'etc', 'call', 'rattl', 'instrumentssom', 'interest', 'thing', 'found', 'hot', 'pink', 'star', 'guitar', 'made', 'want', 'tri', 'play', 'guitar', 'tini', 'instrument', 'victori', 'piano', 'ive', 'never', 'seen', 'close', 'person', 'trip', 'piano', 'room', 'organ', 'room', 'oh', 'sweet', 'heaven', 'good', 'thing', 'lot', 'secur', 'tempt', 'sit', 'play', 'want', 'play', 'piano', 'badli', 'room', 'tri', 'hand', 'stuff', 'never', 'work', 'art', 'display', 'onlytoward', 'end', 'museum', 'close', 'found', 'hard', 'take', 'time', 'see', 'rest', 'id', 'alreadi', 'spent', 'hour', 'therei', 'probabl', 'need', 'anoth', 'hour', 'soim', 'sure', 'space', 'go', 'great', 'concert', 'realli', 'enjoy', 'trip', 'sad', 'star', 'two', 'main', 'reason', 'suppos', 'museum', 'someth', 'enjoy', 'time', 'time', 'doesnt', 'look', 'like', 'rotat', 'special', 'exhibit', 'make', 'hard', 'justifi', 'return', 'navig', 'horribl', 'multipl', 'entranc', 'region', 'one', 'right', 'one', 'allow', 'navig', 'normal', 'pattern', 'howev', 'guid', 'signag', 'anyth', 'prefer', 'entranc', 'though', 'beg', 'ask', 'one', 'one', 'lead', 'unnatur', 'pattern', 'put', 'much', 'time', 'money', 'effort', 'museum', 'realli', 'wish', 'hire', 'ux', 'folk', 'wish', 'betterit', 'worth', 'visit', 'honestli', 'especi', 'music', 'geek', 'like', 'im', 'sure', 'worth']

This past week though it came up quite often, often enough that on Monday, when we were planning our lunch out together for Thursday, we were so hungry by talking about Mrs Whites that it only took until shortly after 11 for us to pile in her car and head out for some good ol' soul food. 

I can't even begin to tell you how wonderful this place is. It's like walking into Grandma's kitchen and getting all those great meals you used to love and enjoy. My mouth was watering and my stomach was singing before I even had a chance to sit down. 

I like that all the meals are the same price. It makes it so much easier. I also like the selection of sides and dishes. The red kool-aid was delicious but not in a mason jar like Lolos.

The staff was very friendly. One of my coworkers was craving ox tail and it started a big discussion between us and our waitress. She mentioned that Mr. Larry might know when it was available again (they were apparently out of it that day) and he even came out to the table to talk to us. My friend also then got his ox tail. I tried it. It's really damn good. I'd probably order it if it was available the next time I came around.

I went for the 3 piece smothered chicken (fried chicken and gravy) and red beans and rice. Wow that is a lot of food. I devoured the chicken fairly quickly. It was delicious. Best friend chicken I've had aside from my Grandma's. The red beans and rice I had to package up and bring home. I had them for dinner tonight and they were just as delicious as I imagined. 

I also tasted one bite of the peach cobbler a la mode. Peaches are not one of my favorite fruits but damn did they do it right. 

If you haven't been here, it's a definite must. I'm not sure why you're still reading this. Pack up and go.

We were immediately led to a table and given menus. The staff gave us enough time to look over our menus and think of any questions we wanted to ask in our heads first. When we finally ordered, we decided to try the quail appetizer and then each had questions on dishes. In response to my guest's questions, samples were brought out to try, which I thought was excellent.

I asked their opinion in regard to the best of the spicy flavorful dishes and it was suggested I try the lemongrass chili chicken which I did. 

Unfortunately, our food came out and our appetizer was forgotten about. However, the food was plenty and I ended up not even being able to finish it all anyway. The spice was right on par and we both seemed to enjoy our lunch there. 

I will be back again, as I found several dishes I wanted to try, which is the key to high rating and return visit with me, and hopefully next time I will try the 40+ advertised wines.

It happened to chance that three friends were in an impromptu mood for sushi and decided this is where we shall meet for this sushi eating experience we were about to have. 

The bar I have to admit is a little hard to find at first, but all in all I love that it's hidden way in the back. The bar service was also fantastic. Very prompt and not pushy.  The polka dot Riesling I first discovered at Fry's because of its name greeted me at the bar and we had a very happy gathering. The anime movies playing quietly off to the side. What a great touch!!

The food was pretty on point. I had some of the best sashimi I had ever had and some great rolls and nigiri also. I left the right amount of full (not overfull) and happy. Speaking of happy, happy hour prices started a little after we were seated and were accounted for as so on our bill.

Why the comedy of errors then? The first error was the staff completely ignoring us back in our little spot in the bar waiting to be seated. It took nearly an hour and us reminding them in order to get a table. 

Second was the wine incident which was hilarious. I ordered a second glass of polka dot while we were at the table. Our waitress comes back with the Riesling and instead of starting to pour some in my empty wine glass, she adds a bit to my water. We thought it was super funny and were not really upset. I think a joke was even made about turning water into wine! :) Needless to say, she was embarrassed and promptly brought me back enough wine four twice the number of pours you usually get.  

It's a little out of the way, but I'll be back. It's nice to know it's an option of Delux has a long line :)

Slight recommendation though.. if you have white paper tablecloths that are disposable, offer crayons.

It's just an awesome amazing experience. 

They also never seem to mind me going in and gawking at instruments for hours on end. I always tell myself someday I am going to learn a new instrument, and going in there causes me to think of at least 10 I want to play... especially when I stare at the drums.

First off I love the atmosphere in this place. Such a cute, southern, home-like, relaxing feel. Mismatched lamps FTW!! There's plenty of room on the inside and various different areas to sit in, which makes it interesting each time you visit. 

I've never had slow or bad service here. The server my first time there not only was speedy and attentive but as I finished their version of an arnold palmer I was asked if I wanted to try a variation of it next. It was incredible. The food was also amazingly delicious. Their fried pickles are pretty authentic in my opinion. Our waitress this time was just as fantastic.

The barbeque always good. I have had better luck with the garlic mashed potatoes than the mashed sweet potatoes. As far as drinks the Muddy Waters (non-alcoholic) is fantastic as is a drink I had today that actually involved a sweet tea vodka. Unbelievable.

This area is filled with trails and hiking and has a nice little side parking lot underneath an overpass so you don't have to park in the dog park\/playground area. 

I was absolutely amazed to see the Loma Del Rio Ruins, which I had no idea existed. It brought a sense of peacefulness on top of being thought provocative (yeah, I just wanted to use the word provocative). It was wondrous to see the lush green areas, that even though you can't always see the water, give way to its presence. 

None of the trails are very long or intense, so they're perfect for beginners or relaxing hikes. Additionally, they have handicapped accessible trails also. What a great addition.

Jenny was recommended to me when I initially started browsing houses. When I needed to take a break from looking, no one got upset, no one was offended and no one pushed me. When I was ready, Jenny was there. 

First thing that I really appreciate was her professionalism. She always came prepared to showings with all the information from the MLS listing and prepared me for anything I may need to know beforehand. When it came to paperwork and the house buying checklist, she was on top of it and made sure that I didn't miss a beat and was ahead of schedule for anything I needed to sign, stamp or seal.

Jenny was also prepared and a super trooper for real. Need to walk in a monsoon flooded yard to check the condition of the roof... in heels? No worries. Need to go back and forth around a house to find a lock box that ends up being behind prickly bushes? No worries. Need to find out the skinny on a house that you adore but that has a public hearing sign in front of it and the LISTING agent doesn't know why it's there? No worries. She's totally on top of it.

She's super nice and funny too. She's totally down to earth and isn't afraid to tell me exactly what I'm in for and what to look out for and point out both positive and negative features of houses and their neighborhoods. 

Bonus for you mid-century modern lovers because that's exactly what Twins and Co specializes in!

And if this isn't enough for you, she is still there for you after the sale. You know.. when your water stops getting hot.. your oven acts up.. and everything in between. She's helped me figure out what's a home warranty issue, what's not and contacted the home inspector to help me out too when an answer was needed.

I am positive they put the same effort into the houses they sell also. 

If you are in the market to buy or in the market to sell, you cannot miss an opportunity to work with this wonderful team.

I first stumbled across Solo due to it being connected to Altered Ego Salon & Spa, where i was able to order a tasty beverage from my salon chair. The first mocha was heaven and we have been inseparable ever since. 

One of my favorite elements of Solo is the atmosphere. It has a feel that is truly all its own. While the furniture and initial look may seem like the typical eclectic coffeehouse, I assure you it is so much more. The cafe has unique and comfortable furniture, games to play, books to read, and free wifi. The lighting is just perfect so that anyone can feel comfortable working yet also take a break and be instantaneously relaxed.

Equally important is their amazing menu and fabulous coffee skills. I can never get enough of the cherry danish and an iced peppermint cream, which is a tea-based beverage. I can also say that they have the best mocha I've had in the Phoenix area to date. 

Last but not least is the friendly staff.

If so, have I got news for you!!

Hamburger Haven has black and white checker floors, driftwood AND sea birds. Don't worry. They only look real. They won't try to eat your hamburger. That's all for you.

I was totally not expecting the decor I saw in this place once I arrived one day on one of those ""need food now, name the first place you can think of go"" type moments. Not with the name Hamburger Haven. Or with the typical strip mall dive bar look from the parking lot. And let me tell you. Hamburgers ARE more fun to eat by the sea!

The menu was vast and delicious. Some of them lacked descriptions of specific items on the hamburgers, but after asking I decided to go with a green chile burger, which is my typical go to and I was not disappointed. A good amount of grease but not too much I needed the entire napkin container. The flavor on both the burger and the chile was out of the world.

Another bonus is that this Target is Super. And close to the light rail. And by close, I mean it is right there.

Last time I walked into Target I ended up buying two pillows for my sofa that *finally* matched my awkwardly awesome accent color in my living room. And Mortal Kombat. Where else can you do that? And don't say Wal-Mart. No one has those damn pillows. No one but Target. 

Sometimes Target is funny too. And not just on April Fools Day. One time I saw an item was out of stock, and there was a label near it listing a replacement item, that was in fact, not a replacement item at all. I love catching things like that. You amuse me Target.

I was excited at the opportunity to try another Thai place. This may sound completely odd, but the year and a half I spent in Detroit really increased my Thai snobbery. It's been hard finding a great Thai place here. 

The restaurant is tucked away in a strip mall next to a church. The sign is hard to see from the road and I went past it the first time and almost missed it the 2nd time too. However, the inside is very cut and cozy. It's not very large and has a warm and inviting feel. 

For an appetizer we had crispy spring rolls, which were pretty much your average spring roll. Not too bad, but nothing fancy or exceptionally spectacular either.

For dinner I decided to try their version of Evil Jungle Princess with medium spice as I usually get. Typically medium ranges from tolerable to almost not tolerable. This time it tasted like they had put absolutely no spice in at all. It wasn't bad and I did bring the rest home to hav tomorrow, but it's not nearly as flavorful as other Thai places I have been to in the past. 

The service is good and the prices are very reasonable. They also have an extensive menu.

** Beautiful outside seating
** A menu I'd love to eat at for days
** Breakfast til 4. Yes folks.. 4pm.

I ended up at DD on a day when I was going to make my first visit to Orange Table but running out of time we decided to try another option. We literally saw a sign that said sandwiches (it was really the place next door) and just pulled in.

The menu the menu, oh the sweet menu. There are a million amazing items on this menu that I want to try, and no, not just for breakfast, which they serve until 4 by the way. On weekdays. Did I tell you that already? Sorry, I might say it a few more times. I was torn between a few breakfast options and only glanced a bit at lunch, but it looked very tempting also. 

We all I know I love me some eggs benedict, and the server insisted they have the best sauce around so I thought I'd give it a try. Probably should've gotten something else. I was not a fan of their benedict sauce at all. However, they do give you several options for the meat portion including salmon, and turkey sausage, which was what I tried, though it looked more like an actual piece of turkey rather than a sausage.

I wished someone had mentioned smoothies to me before I ordered my beverage too as they had a black cherry mint that I would've loved to try. Also on my list to try.. peach creme brulee :)

The service was great, the patio was beautiful, right down to the sexy tabletops and they even have free wifi apparently.

Now that I have your attention... ;)

What a nice little place this is. I was there on a Thursday night and it was rather peaceful and quiet. The relaxing atmosphere was just what the doctor ordered on a night of catching up with a friend I haven't seen in awhile.  While it seems small, I am amazed at how much space there really is there. 

I started with an arnold palmer which was delicious. So much so, that I stayed with it the entire night. Everything on the menu to me looked good, but nothing really stood out as fantastic-I-have-to-have-that-right-now good. Craving flavor, as I have been lately, I went with the green chile stew item. While small, it was the right amount of food and had a pretty good flavor. 

The killer part of the night though was the dessert that we shouldn't have had but decided to share. The one both of us agreed on was the chocolate cake with caramel. We were expecting cake. We were expecting gelato. We were expecting caramel. We were NOT expecting caramel corn. 

Holy mouthgasm St. Francis! 

I'm not a fan of super sweet things so the mix of the salty totally did me in and we found ourselves eating almost every last bit of that cake. Heaven. Try that cake! At one point I believe I mentioned I wanted to marry whomever is responsible.

In the end, the dessert was fantastic and the mood was great, but none of the dishes screamed at me. I may be back for that cake though."	4	3	4	['hail', 'server', 'gave', 'go', 'contain', 'caramel', 'popcorn', 'way', 'there', 'deeper', 'sexier', 'stori', 'caramel', 'popcorn', 'ill', 'get', 'back', 'thatnow', 'attent', 'nice', 'littl', 'place', 'thursday', 'night', 'rather', 'peac', 'quiet', 'relax', 'atmospher', 'doctor', 'order', 'night', 'catch', 'friend', 'havent', 'seen', 'awhil', 'seem', 'small', 'amaz', 'much', 'space', 'realli', 'start', 'arnold', 'palmer', 'delici', 'much', 'stay', 'entir', 'night', 'everyth', 'menu', 'look', 'good', 'noth', 'realli', 'stood', 'fantasticihavetohavethatrightnow', 'good', 'crave', 'flavor', 'late', 'went', 'green', 'chile', 'stew', 'item', 'small', 'right', 'amount', 'food', 'pretti', 'good', 'flavor', 'killer', 'part', 'night', 'though', 'dessert', 'shouldnt', 'decid', 'share', 'one', 'us', 'agre', 'chocol', 'cake', 'caramel', 'expect', 'cake', 'expect', 'gelato', 'expect', 'caramel', 'expect', 'caramel', 'corn', 'holi', 'mouthgasm', 'st', 'franci', 'im', 'fan', 'super', 'sweet', 'thing', 'mix', 'salti', 'total', 'found', 'eat', 'almost', 'everi', 'last', 'bit', 'cake', 'heaven', 'tri', 'cake', 'one', 'point', 'believ', 'mention', 'want', 'marri', 'whomev', 'responsiblein', 'end', 'dessert', 'fantast', 'mood', 'great', 'none', 'dish', 'scream', 'may', 'back', 'cake', 'though']

I went years before realizing El Coquito was within walking distance of my office. And it didn't take more than a few days before we were dying to try it once we found out. 

El Coquito is kinda tucked away in an old plaza off of McDowell on Granite Reef. The inside has a nice homey feel to it. Various tables of different sizes, pictures on the wall, a TV playing some good ol' futbol. We arrived 5 minutes before the website said they open, and we weren't even the first ones there. Fair warning, that you may want to give yourself time as the place is small and appears to fill up fast.

Be assured though, that the service is still top notch. We were greeted promptly and our food came quickly and just as ordered. I ordered the mofongo with pork and an unleaded coquito. And for the half hour I sat and savored that meal, I was completely overcome with bliss. The textures were great, everything was the right consistency and temperature and the flavors were amazing. Be prepared for the high garlic content, especially if you use the extra garlic that comes on the side, which I did. May want to wait while before smooching anyone. 

Highly recommended, and a place I know I will be back to on various occasions.

Equipment: Would give 4 stars due to equipment being down for a long time, but when I ask when it's getting fixed, the employees have an answer for me for the most part. For example the Smith Machine has been down for a while, but they explained that the part they need is coming in December, so at least they have an answer. Other than that, there is a wide variety of equipment to use and it's never TOO crowded or busy so something you need is bound to be open. 
Personal trainers: of course it's their job to sell you packages, so they can be pushy, but even when you don't buy a package they still walk around and are supportive of other people exercising which I think is nice.
Cleanliness: is good enough, I have noticed the last month or so that employees are doing a better job cleaning. 
Wet Area: was recently re done and closed for over 2 months, but it's a very nice remodel, nothing too fancy but the sauna, steam room, and pool look clean and nice to use. 
Child care: my favorite part of the entire gym!! Reason why I'm giving 5 instead of 4 stars. The girls that work there are so nice and always welcoming and I always see them playing with the kids. My son is 4 years old and absolutely loves the ladies that usually work nights, Natalie, and Alexis to be specific. My son makes me go to the gym so he can see them, which is a good motivating factor to work out for me.

They make the best cappuccinos and the adorable drawings they make on them are a life saver. If you're looking for a snack - their lemon poppy seed cake is a safe bet and always perfectly lemony, moist and satisfying. 

Their sandwiches are on the pricier side but are consistent, delicious and the ingredients are fresh. 

The staff is wonderful and the cafe is charming. The only downside is the outlets can be tricky to acquire - but alas not everything can be perfect!"	0	0	0	['cafe', 'castel', 'awesom', 'spot', 'quick', 'coffe', 'go', 'catch', 'old', 'friend', 'solo', 'coffe', 'studi', 'session', 'make', 'best', 'cappuccino', 'ador', 'draw', 'make', 'life', 'saver', 'your', 'look', 'snack', 'lemon', 'poppi', 'seed', 'cake', 'safe', 'bet', 'alway', 'perfectli', 'lemoni', 'moist', 'satisfi', 'sandwich', 'pricier', 'side', 'consist', 'delici', 'ingredi', 'fresh', 'staff', 'wonder', 'cafe', 'charm', 'downsid', 'outlet', 'tricki', 'acquir', 'ala', 'everyth', 'perfect']

The reason I'm giving them 3 stars is the recent decline in topping variety they've been offering. They don't replace toppings once they run out so you're confronted with upsettingly empty bins where peanut butter cups used to be. They've also reduced their fruit options by a lot so I can't kid myself about being healthy. 

The service is lovely and I like their seating area but it's a coin-toss regarding the actual product because some days they're properly stocked and other days it's a disappointment."	1	1	0	['yogurt', 'qualiti', 'fine', 'hit', 'miss', 'varieti', 'given', 'mani', 'machin', 'run', 'reason', 'im', 'give', 'star', 'recent', 'declin', 'top', 'varieti', 'theyv', 'offer', 'dont', 'replac', 'top', 'run', 'your', 'confront', 'upsettingli', 'empti', 'bin', 'peanut', 'butter', 'cup', 'use', 'theyv', 'also', 'reduc', 'fruit', 'option', 'lot', 'cant', 'kid', 'healthi', 'servic', 'love', 'like', 'seat', 'area', 'cointoss', 'regard', 'actual', 'product', 'day', 'theyr', 'properli', 'stock', 'day', 'disappoint']

Highlight if the visit was how wonderful all of the staff was about the twin five year old boys dining with us. They offered to bring fresh buns when the burger ""hat"" came slathered in mayo and were very sweet and patient taking their orders. 

The food was yummy and i was glad for the variety of options on the menu but nothing was super memorable.

I'm just chiming in with all the other reviewers here to say that this is where you've gotta go for a fun evening with friends. You can actually talk to everyone there, enjoy your company and wake up the next morning at a human time because you didn't exhaust yourself! 

The ""gamesmasters"" are amazing and pick out the perfect games. The service is fantastic and so friendly! I had a slightly strange interaction waiting in line because I went in to get my name put down and the host seemed very annoyed at me! I didn't realize they weren't taking down names! The line up outside is always long so steel yourself for that. 

I didn't give them a 5-star review because the food isn't very good. My friend ordered the saddest looking nachos (yikes) and the hot chocolate I got wasn't memorable. I think ones best bet is to go with their selection of david's tea or their beers.

With large screens set up around the restuarant - you can really enjoy whatever game is going on. I had a portobello panini that was fantastic to say the least. However, the side salad really stole the show and I wish I could've ordered it as my main! My only advice is if you go here ORDER THE SIDE SALAD!

The problem with Marche is that you walk in and are overwhelmed by the options and the abundance of choice. No worries though because I've written you a handy list of pro tips to enjoy Marche; 

1) Avoid office lunch rush hours. If you want to go from 12 - 1:30 then you're committing to a very chaotic experience

2) If you're in an indecisive mood just skip marche for that day (i.e. it took you more than 2 minutes to pick out your outfit in the morning)

3) Try their rosti - it's a classic!

My personal favourite is their green curry but just explore and enjoy!!!"	1	0	1	['love', 'march', 'sinc', 'went', 'kid', 'locat', 'singaporeth', 'problem', 'march', 'walk', 'overwhelm', 'option', 'abund', 'choic', 'worri', 'though', 'ive', 'written', 'handi', 'list', 'pro', 'tip', 'enjoy', 'march', 'avoid', 'offic', 'lunch', 'rush', 'hour', 'want', 'go', 'your', 'commit', 'chaotic', 'experi', 'your', 'indecis', 'mood', 'skip', 'march', 'day', 'ie', 'took', 'minut', 'pick', 'outfit', 'morn', 'tri', 'rosti', 'classicmi', 'person', 'favourit', 'green', 'curri', 'explor', 'enjoy']
