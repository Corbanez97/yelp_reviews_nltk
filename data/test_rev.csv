Went with a party of four - we were seated immediately. The waitress was quick and polite and answered all of our questions. The owner was really sweet and came over to our table to explain a dish to us since we weren't familiar with burmese food. 

Everyone was really happy with their meals and extra points for so many veggie options! 

Definitely will be back again!"	1	0	1	['yum', 'yum', 'yumwent', 'parti', 'four', 'seat', 'immedi', 'waitress', 'quick', 'polit', 'answer', 'question', 'owner', 'realli', 'sweet', 'came', 'tabl', 'explain', 'dish', 'us', 'sinc', 'werent', 'familiar', 'burmes', 'food', 'everyon', 'realli', 'happi', 'meal', 'extra', 'point', 'mani', 'veggi', 'option', 'definit', 'back']

It is a little ridiculous to walk into a coffee shop and not have a menu to scope out! 

I ended up ordering a cappuccino which was okay. What was cool is the milk they use is from a local organic producer and you could taste the quality. The espresso in the cappuccino wasn't too special.

The salads are delicious and the portion sizing is huge! Good thing it's a salad so there is no harm in actually finishing what you get! I've had the Tokyo and the Mexican - both were really incredible.

The service was great and they didn't rush us out the door which was really pleasant.

We all ordered the dinner plates which came with tri-coloured rice, salad and then meat or vegetables. My vegetarian plate was unmemorable. The rice was a great quality but really flavourless.

Onto the service: it was okay and the waitress checked in on us a few times. The food took a very long time and we saw some people who came in earlier getting their food before us. We tried not to stare at them jealously but I think they noticed (whoops). 

The food: I got the ricotta pancakes - one of the few vegetarian options on the menu. The ricotta and sour cherry toppings served no purpose to the dish. They used real maple syrup which was lovely but the pancakes were just a disappointing vehicle for the syrup. 

We ordered cappuccinos which came served in water glasses. This meant the glasses were too hot for us to hold and we had to wait for our drinks to cool down which was just so impractical.

LOVED that they had two vegetarian options which were very distinct from each other. There was a creamy vegan broth with a thick noodle which was very rich and paired well with the silken tofu topping and thick and chewy ramen noodle. The second option was a vegetarian broth that was lighter and much more savoury topped with a tonne of vegetables and a lighter noodle.

love this place and everything about it. 
The prices - Yes
The food - Yes
the live music?! - Yes
the service - Yes
the ambience - Yes

Everything about Arepera du plateau is such a yes. There tends to be a bit of a wait when you get there but their system is efficient so it doesn't take to long. The menu is simple and delightful - if you don't get their yuca chips + avocado sauce you're making a life mistake. If you go at around 7pm there is a live musician who plays latino music and sings with this beautiful soulful voice. It's a quick service and the waiters and sweet.

South Indian food is a completely unique flavour profile then what you might try at your standard Indian resto in Montreal like Maison Du Cari or Le Taj which serve up North Indian fare. 

The menu is vast and most of it top notch. If you're a first timer my advice is stick to the south indian classics. 

Starter:  Idlis or Rasam vada. (the first a steamed rice batter dumplings, the latter are fried)
Main: Dosa! Be adventurous and prepare to get your hands a little dirty as you eat - it well taste best if you attack with your hands. Every dosa comes with sambhar - a lentil soup and chuntneys which are high quality and absolutely delicious.
End: must try the south Indian filter coffee. It's unique to the south - sweet and strong.

The good news is I've found it. Lan Zhou has the most incredible hand pulled noodles which are slightly chewy and oh so fresh. Their vegetable noodle soup comes in a different broth that they make and tastes incredible. I asked the waiter what the broth is made of and he said it's a secret recipe - how alluring. The coolest part is you can ask for the noodle size you want when you order because they make them to order.

I had the wonderful pleasure of being assisted by the shop's namesake Chloe herself. She gave me a fresh cardamom chocolate which was absolutely brilliant. I picked up a sponge toffee and from Chloe's recommendation her masala chocolate bar. 

The sponge toffee is absolute perfection! Crispy and not too sweet, coated in a thing layer of chocolate. Now with the masala chocolate bar I was slightly suspicious....it just didn't make sense to me. All my worries were washed away after one bite of this chocolate bar. It was smooth and silky with light hints of different spices that were married into the milky sweet chocolate. 

Beyond the delicious treats, the experience in the store is very pleasant. Chloe is such a delight and it's very nice to see the pride she runs her shop with. All of the staff is warm and genuinely just happy (this is why it's Heaven!)

As many of the other reviewers have said, it's a pricey place and there is no debate over that!

However, it's such a pleasant experience to go there browse and pick out a cool tea to try out, some spices or ramen brands you won't find anywhere near by! 

My recommendation would be to go to their sandwich bar and try out the focaccia there and pair it with their fresh orange juice after browsing through and picking out a few interesting grocery items to experiment with!

We entered into the restaurant and were seated right by the door which was unpleasant because of the cold winter draft we were hit with every few minutes. We looked around and there was a table at the back that we took the liberty of moving to; alas we weren't seated there initially!

I started off with a hot & sour soup which tasted okay but was the strangest shade of light grey; not the usual colour one expects! We all ordered fried dumplings - I ordered the tofu vegetable kind. It took absolute ages for our food to arrive which was really unexpected. Alas, it was not worth the wait. The filling of my dumplings were too salty and the skins were dry. My friend's dumplings were served in a plate that was pooling with water; which filled their dumplings making them soggy. 

It was all so inconsistent with mediocre service, a long wait and food that was sloppy. Perhaps we went at a bad time but I was left with a bad impression that doesn't entice me to return.

A few people came and got takeout while we were there, and I wonder if others - never having been there before - think it isn't a sit down restaurant?  I don't know, but you can sit down and eat your food there.

I think this place would've gotten more stars from me if the portion sizes had been a little bigger, for one - they seemed to be on the small size for my taste; and also, there were only a few vegetarian options on the menu.  And... this might sound nitpicky, but... the vibe of the place is kind of bland for me, honestly.  There's nothing special about the way it looks or feels, which isn't something I usually complain about, but I feel like a lot could have been added to my experience if the place had a little more character.

That being said, the servers we had were friendly and checked in on us a few times throughout the meal, refilled our drinks when we were nearly out, etc.  So, good service.  And the food was good, as well.  Since most people get takeout here, you're likely to have the place almost entirely to yourself if you come here to eat."	1	1	0	['came', 'friend', 'dinner', 'around', 'place', 'empti', 'peopl', 'came', 'got', 'takeout', 'wonder', 'other', 'never', 'think', 'isnt', 'sit', 'restaur', 'dont', 'know', 'sit', 'eat', 'food', 'therei', 'think', 'place', 'wouldv', 'gotten', 'star', 'portion', 'size', 'littl', 'bigger', 'one', 'seem', 'small', 'size', 'tast', 'also', 'vegetarian', 'option', 'menu', 'might', 'sound', 'nitpicki', 'vibe', 'place', 'kind', 'bland', 'honestli', 'there', 'noth', 'special', 'way', 'look', 'feel', 'isnt', 'someth', 'usual', 'complain', 'feel', 'like', 'lot', 'could', 'ad', 'experi', 'place', 'littl', 'characterthat', 'said', 'server', 'friendli', 'check', 'us', 'time', 'throughout', 'meal', 'refil', 'drink', 'nearli', 'etc', 'good', 'servic', 'food', 'good', 'well', 'sinc', 'peopl', 'get', 'takeout', 'your', 'like', 'place', 'almost', 'entir', 'come', 'eat']

They have a fantastic selection of protein powders\/bars and supplements.  Their prices on protein powder are lower than what I've seen on Amazon (at least for the one I was looking for), and I agree with another reviewer about the associates - they are helpful without being pushy.  VERY important in any store, but especially here, where there are so many comparable products and it's vital to have someone who can help you with your individual needs and not talk you into buying something that you don't really want\/need.  I didn't really utilize that, since I knew what I wanted, but I did notice it with other customers who were there at the same time as I was.  Definitely coming back here!

I've always loved Celine's music, but when I went, her husband's death was still fresh enough that she honored him in her concert.  To feel her love for him, and to feel the crowd's love for her (and I was among them), and her love for her fans - a sincere and kind love - was almost overwhelming to me at points.  There is no lip-syncing here.  She is real, and completely amazing, in every note of every song.

That being said, the cremini mushroom and egg dish I had was VERY good, and very filling.  It doesn't look like a lot of food, but it was more than enough for me.  I couldn't finish it.  The service here is also excellent.  The servers really take care of you.  I did not run out of water until the very last moment, after we paid the checks and were about to leave.

I have no idea how much it usually costs to get in here, but we got in free - of which I'm glad.  I accidentally left my water bottle in my purse, and luckily they didn't take it, but I still had to dump it out.  I understand no outside liquids, but when I went to the bar to ask for water, they said (alcoholic) drinks were free, but they only had bottled water, and you had to pay for it.  Only in a Las Vegas nightclub would they charge for water when it's 100 degrees outside.  Alcohol dehydrates you.  The least they could do is give me a cup of water from the tap with my alcohol, especially if I'm staying there a while.

I guess I'm not a fan of nightclubs, anyway, because I value my hearing, but it was very crowded, and I hate it when people don't move when you ask.  I definitely physically pushed people out of my way, and got pushed by other people.  I went to the balcony to try and spot my friends on the dance floor below, and the people standing there literally pushed me back so they could stand there and talk and not let me even see.  Welcome to Las Vegas.

As I was going in and out of the club, there are so many different lines, and you literally feel like you're being herded like cattle.  The staff is not paid to be friendly, I suppose, but only one of the staff members I interacted with had any notable personality (actually it was the guy who asked me to dump out my water, and he was friendly and funny about it, which is why I obliged so easily).  And yes, I'm also confused as to why the dance floor is roped off.  It was so crowded that I could hardly move.

I've been to other nightclubs that I liked more, so unless they have another free event, I likely won't be back anytime soon."	2	2	0	['went', 'last', 'night', 'friend', 'cocktail', 'citi', 'event', 'idea', 'much', 'usual', 'cost', 'get', 'got', 'free', 'im', 'glad', 'accident', 'left', 'water', 'bottl', 'purs', 'luckili', 'didnt', 'take', 'still', 'dump', 'understand', 'outsid', 'liquid', 'went', 'bar', 'ask', 'water', 'said', 'alcohol', 'drink', 'free', 'bottl', 'water', 'pay', 'la', 'vega', 'nightclub', 'would', 'charg', 'water', 'degre', 'outsid', 'alcohol', 'dehydr', 'least', 'could', 'give', 'cup', 'water', 'tap', 'alcohol', 'especi', 'im', 'stay', 'whilei', 'guess', 'im', 'fan', 'nightclub', 'anyway', 'valu', 'hear', 'crowd', 'hate', 'peopl', 'dont', 'move', 'ask', 'definit', 'physic', 'push', 'peopl', 'way', 'got', 'push', 'peopl', 'went', 'balconi', 'tri', 'spot', 'friend', 'danc', 'floor', 'peopl', 'stand', 'liter', 'push', 'back', 'could', 'stand', 'talk', 'let', 'even', 'see', 'welcom', 'la', 'vegasa', 'go', 'club', 'mani', 'differ', 'line', 'liter', 'feel', 'like', 'your', 'herd', 'like', 'cattl', 'staff', 'paid', 'friendli', 'suppos', 'one', 'staff', 'member', 'interact', 'notabl', 'person', 'actual', 'guy', 'ask', 'dump', 'water', 'friendli', 'funni', 'oblig', 'easili', 'ye', 'im', 'also', 'confus', 'danc', 'floor', 'rope', 'crowd', 'could', 'hardli', 'moveiv', 'nightclub', 'like', 'unless', 'anoth', 'free', 'event', 'like', 'wont', 'back', 'anytim', 'soon']

It has an intimate, almost jazz club feel, rather than the typical Vegas dance-oriented night club.  I like the piano and the singers they have.  All that being said, the drinks (and I'm assuming food, as well) are expensive, so plan accordingly.  I think there was a cover charge, as well, when I went (though I can't remember what it was).  Interesting place, but be sure to bring a fresh credit card with you.	3	0	0	['vibe', 'place', 'real', 'draw', 'intim', 'almost', 'jazz', 'club', 'feel', 'rather', 'typic', 'vega', 'danceori', 'night', 'club', 'like', 'piano', 'singer', 'said', 'drink', 'im', 'assum', 'food', 'well', 'expens', 'plan', 'accordingli', 'think', 'cover', 'charg', 'well', 'went', 'though', 'cant', 'rememb', 'interest', 'place', 'sure', 'bring', 'fresh', 'credit', 'card']

I was in a hurry, though, so I look forward to coming back and enjoying spending more time asking the workers there about the animals, as well as feeding the giraffe - maybe even having it paint for me!  (Yes, for a small fee, you can feed the giraffe, and pick paint colors for him to use on a canvas you hold and get to keep as a souvenir.)  Fun fact: I did learn on my short trip that some of the lions here are rescues, but many are direct descendants of the original, famous MGM lions.

The openness of the lounge's setup makes it easy for people strolling by to get a look at who's playing, and there's a pretty good amount of seating room.  The dance floor is small, but the coolness of this place comes from how much history has taken place there.  It's one of the very small number of lounges that is pretty much original from the age of Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin.  Just, don't ask the bar to make you a mojito.  I made that mistake, and they gave me something that tasted like chocolate-mint flavored awfulness.  Other than that, feel free to check out no-cover shows taking place there Tuesday through Saturday nights, starting at 10 pm.  After midnight DJs take over, and the place turns into an all-out dance party.  (Live musicians are more my thing, though, being one myself.)  ; )  A neat venue with great entertainment.	3	0	0	['ive', 'play', 'show', 'entertain', 'point', 'view', 'great', 'venu', 'open', 'loung', 'setup', 'make', 'easi', 'peopl', 'stroll', 'get', 'look', 'who', 'play', 'there', 'pretti', 'good', 'amount', 'seat', 'room', 'danc', 'floor', 'small', 'cool', 'place', 'come', 'much', 'histori', 'taken', 'place', 'one', 'small', 'number', 'loung', 'pretti', 'much', 'origin', 'age', 'frank', 'sinatra', 'dean', 'martin', 'dont', 'ask', 'bar', 'make', 'mojito', 'made', 'mistak', 'gave', 'someth', 'tast', 'like', 'chocolatemint', 'flavor', 'aw', 'feel', 'free', 'check', 'nocov', 'show', 'take', 'place', 'tuesday', 'saturday', 'night', 'start', 'pm', 'midnight', 'dj', 'take', 'place', 'turn', 'allout', 'danc', 'parti', 'live', 'musician', 'thing', 'though', 'one', 'neat', 'venu', 'great', 'entertain']

Best part of all, it's completely free, you can take as many pictures as you want, and it's open 24\/7 (except when they're redoing the displays).  They change the garden from season to season, and also for holidays, so it's something you can see many times and never have a repeat experience, whether you're a local or a tourist.

I avoid sugar, so I just had fruit on the side that I could put on top, instead of syrup.  The real highlight of the food was the fresh-squeezed tangerine juice that I had.  Holy crapola, it was SO good!!  Our server was nice and attentive, and the place was clean overall.  Really enjoyed looking at all the celeb memorabilia all over the walls, as well.  I'm super healthy and a vegetarian, so honestly there's not much here for me, but I definitely consider this an ok place to come for breakfast.	0	0	0	['id', 'give', 'place', 'could', 'pancak', 'huge', 'fill', 'blueberri', 'delici', 'avoid', 'sugar', 'fruit', 'side', 'could', 'put', 'top', 'instead', 'syrup', 'real', 'highlight', 'food', 'freshsqueez', 'tangerin', 'juic', 'holi', 'crapola', 'good', 'server', 'nice', 'attent', 'place', 'clean', 'overal', 'realli', 'enjoy', 'look', 'celeb', 'memorabilia', 'wall', 'well', 'im', 'super', 'healthi', 'vegetarian', 'honestli', 'there', 'much', 'definit', 'consid', 'ok', 'place', 'come', 'breakfast']

I went here with a friend recently, and the experience was - for the most part - great.  Being a vegetarian, it's always awesome to find an entire portion of a menu devoted to vegan- or vegetarian-friendly items; but Gardein??  Love love love.  I got a Gardein chicken sandwich, and it was delicious.

The only problem with our order was with my friend's sandwich.  She has a sulfur allergy, and requested one of the toppings be held from her order; though the waiter Did, in fact, input the order correctly, there was a miscommunication somewhere and the offending ingredient wasn't removed.  She realized it as soon as she bit into it, so not much harm done, but if it were a life or death allergy, this would've been serious.  They remade the sandwich for her, and both our waiter and the manager came by to personally apologize for the incorrect (and in this case, hazardous) order.  Though, of course, we would've preferred the order be correct to start with, we're just glad the situation was rectified.  The service we received made up for the error.

I definitely plan on returning to try more of the wondrous vegetarian and vegan options.

Boba S.
Comment from Boba S. of Kung Fu Tea 
Business Owner
9\/19\/2016  Hello KATHIE

I appreciate you taking the time to write your thoughts and opinions about the Kung Fu Tea franchise.

I did some investigating on your visit today and I do apologize for some misunderstandings here.  I did ask KEVAN about this customization and he did not approve such a thing.  We are a franchise and unfortunately NOT allowed this.  I agree with you!  Mango&Passion is NOT a WACKY drink.  Alas the higher powers that be do not allow this.  In fact NEVER.  Trouble has been issued to us for such WACKY concoctions.  Silly?  I concur.

I do hope you re-consider your review about this matter.  We really can't do it.  Your disdainful rating will have to stay with us.  You can hate us, be long gone with us, and be happy at Starbucks.  We try our best and if we messed up your drink.. Sorry again.  

You can go to the other Kung Fu Tea... They will get in trouble.  In fact you just got them in trouble.  No stamp cards there either.  I think YOU should question them about it.  Not us.

Dominic
************UPDATE\/RESPONSE*** 9\/20\/2016**********************
Thank you for your reply.

Who are you suggesting I question, and about what?

As a point of clarification, in the past Kevan made these drinks for us himself. It wasn't necessarily a matter of needing his approval?... regardless, I completely understand now that it was not something he ""should"" have been doing and that you are bounded by rules.... rules that do not reflect amazing customer experiences.

Dominic I'd be more than happy to give your store the 5 stars it deserves, but you too are missing the big picture. You FAIL to acknowledge it in your reply as well. You failed to show us how much you CARE about our needs as the customer. You expressed understanding about our frustrations... BUT as the OWNER you offered NO further solutions... as simple as

 ""I will continue to submit requests the to the powers that be for this alteration as I understand this change will make many of my customers happy."" 

YOU are the person in the best position to express this need and push for the changes to occur. BUT you mentioned nothing of the sort. I'm a little disappointed."	0	0	0	['repli', 'boba', 'scomment', 'boba', 'kung', 'fu', 'tea', 'busi', 'owner', 'hello', 'kathiei', 'appreci', 'take', 'time', 'write', 'thought', 'opinion', 'kung', 'fu', 'tea', 'franchisei', 'investig', 'visit', 'today', 'apolog', 'misunderstand', 'ask', 'kevan', 'custom', 'approv', 'thing', 'franchis', 'unfortun', 'allow', 'agre', 'mangopass', 'wacki', 'drink', 'ala', 'higher', 'power', 'allow', 'fact', 'never', 'troubl', 'issu', 'us', 'wacki', 'concoct', 'silli', 'concuri', 'hope', 'reconsid', 'review', 'matter', 'realli', 'cant', 'disdain', 'rate', 'stay', 'us', 'hate', 'us', 'long', 'gone', 'us', 'happi', 'starbuck', 'tri', 'best', 'mess', 'drink', 'sorri', 'go', 'kung', 'fu', 'tea', 'get', 'troubl', 'fact', 'got', 'troubl', 'stamp', 'card', 'either', 'think', 'question', 'usdominicupdaterespons', 'thank', 'replywho', 'suggest', 'question', 'whata', 'point', 'clarif', 'past', 'kevan', 'made', 'drink', 'us', 'wasnt', 'necessarili', 'matter', 'need', 'approv', 'regardless', 'complet', 'understand', 'someth', 'bound', 'rule', 'rule', 'reflect', 'amaz', 'custom', 'experiencesdomin', 'id', 'happi', 'give', 'store', 'star', 'deserv', 'miss', 'big', 'pictur', 'fail', 'acknowledg', 'repli', 'well', 'fail', 'show', 'us', 'much', 'care', 'need', 'custom', 'express', 'understand', 'frustrat', 'owner', 'offer', 'solut', 'simpl', 'continu', 'submit', 'request', 'power', 'alter', 'understand', 'chang', 'make', 'mani', 'custom', 'happi', 'person', 'best', 'posit', 'express', 'need', 'push', 'chang', 'occur', 'mention', 'noth', 'sort', 'im', 'littl', 'disappoint']

Today I had the worst customer experience of my life. I asked the cashier ""When you have a moment could you please come wipe out table down its kind of sticky"" the place was dead and he wasn't occupied but he never came. Ok I thought no worries. Our food was delivered to us by another gentlemen by the name of Daniel. I asked Daniel ""Could you wipe the table down for us when you get a chance"" he replied ""sure"". As he walked away with his back turned to he says ""a please would be appreciated "" in a completely passive aggressive tone. He's right I should have said please but that doesn't change the fact that he was being completely unprofessional. When he came back I proceeded to address the situation as he comment made me feel really uncomfortable. I told him hey I don't appreciate being spoken to In such an aggressive manner. He then proceeded to argue and escalate the situation in a completely immature way. Cherry on top when our argument concluded he followed it up with ""cool story bro"" that really got my blood boiling. I'm not one to complain but I felt the need to get a manager involved at this point. Their employee had disrespected me and was being completely unprofessional. When I spoke to them they mocked and asked me what they should do ""sit him down and give him a stern talking to"" with a huge grin on their face. They essentially blew me off and expect me to believe that will address the situation with the runner? Yea, I don't think so. It wasn't until another runner came out from the kitchen and acknowledged the situation and explained that Daniel can be a bit of a dick. It isn't my fault that's he's a dick or is having a bad day. They shouldn't take it out on their customer and if he can't deal with customers then he shouldn't be working in the customer service industry. I can honestly say that I will not be returning to chicken shack not after the complete disregard they showed for customer satisfaction."	6	1	0	['food', 'great', 'ive', 'go', 'sinc', 'freshman', 'year', 'high', 'school', 'back', 'today', 'worst', 'custom', 'experi', 'life', 'ask', 'cashier', 'moment', 'could', 'pleas', 'come', 'wipe', 'tabl', 'kind', 'sticki', 'place', 'dead', 'wasnt', 'occupi', 'never', 'came', 'ok', 'thought', 'worri', 'food', 'deliv', 'us', 'anoth', 'gentlemen', 'name', 'daniel', 'ask', 'daniel', 'could', 'wipe', 'tabl', 'us', 'get', 'chanc', 'repli', 'sure', 'walk', 'away', 'back', 'turn', 'say', 'pleas', 'would', 'appreci', 'complet', 'passiv', 'aggress', 'tone', 'he', 'right', 'said', 'pleas', 'doesnt', 'chang', 'fact', 'complet', 'unprofession', 'came', 'back', 'proceed', 'address', 'situat', 'comment', 'made', 'feel', 'realli', 'uncomfort', 'told', 'hey', 'dont', 'appreci', 'spoken', 'aggress', 'manner', 'proceed', 'argu', 'escal', 'situat', 'complet', 'immatur', 'way', 'cherri', 'top', 'argument', 'conclud', 'follow', 'cool', 'stori', 'bro', 'realli', 'got', 'blood', 'boil', 'im', 'one', 'complain', 'felt', 'need', 'get', 'manag', 'involv', 'point', 'employe', 'disrespect', 'complet', 'unprofession', 'spoke', 'mock', 'ask', 'sit', 'give', 'stern', 'talk', 'huge', 'grin', 'face', 'essenti', 'blew', 'expect', 'believ', 'address', 'situat', 'runner', 'yea', 'dont', 'think', 'wasnt', 'anoth', 'runner', 'came', 'kitchen', 'acknowledg', 'situat', 'explain', 'daniel', 'bit', 'dick', 'isnt', 'fault', 'that', 'he', 'dick', 'bad', 'day', 'shouldnt', 'take', 'custom', 'cant', 'deal', 'custom', 'shouldnt', 'work', 'custom', 'servic', 'industri', 'honestli', 'say', 'return', 'chicken', 'shack', 'complet', 'disregard', 'show', 'custom', 'satisfact']

I had a chocolate croissant and some other treats that I can't remember the name of. My sister had the bread pudding which was filled with coconut, raisins, and pecans. That was to die for, they serve it warm which it takes a minute to heat up, but still worth  the wait!  Their prices on pastries weren't bad the highest priced items were their bigger items like the muffins for around\/close to $5. The decor in the shop was very unique, there wasn't one thing the same.  The shops tables and chairs are vintage and so are the decorations. Overall it's a great place to go to study or have desert.  Plus they are open 24\/hrs!

It's up the stairs away from the food court in the corner. When you walk in there are 2 other businesses inside so make sure your in the right line. I ordered the original cone vanilla ice cream with a regular doughnut cone ($7) with cinnamon and sugar on the outside. The employees were very friendly! It was my first time trying one so I didn't want to get an extravagant one and not like it. But I loved it and would definitely go back to try their other flavors if I'm ever back in the area.

I'm not sure if the brisket was supposed to have a lot of fat on it but felt like pieces in my potato had more fat than usual. I would only recommend that they let guests have the option to put on their own sauce on the spud other than that it was excellent. Kinda reminded me of Texas BBQ which is hard to duplicate. Very good portions for the price you pay. VERY busy place even for lunch on a Saturday. The line was out the door and took about 10-15min to get through it. The place, of course was packed and very rambunctious, in other words loud. Parking may be difficult if the restaurant is busy \/packed. They also had a country store to the side where you could buy sauce or beef to cook your own.	0	0	0	['first', 'start', 'say', 'give', 'star', 'found', 'brisket', 'spud', 'tad', 'spici', 'im', 'babi', 'come', 'spici', 'im', 'sure', 'brisket', 'suppos', 'lot', 'fat', 'felt', 'like', 'piec', 'potato', 'fat', 'usual', 'would', 'recommend', 'let', 'guest', 'option', 'put', 'sauc', 'spud', 'excel', 'kinda', 'remind', 'texa', 'bbq', 'hard', 'duplic', 'good', 'portion', 'price', 'pay', 'busi', 'place', 'even', 'lunch', 'saturday', 'line', 'door', 'took', 'min', 'get', 'place', 'cours', 'pack', 'rambuncti', 'word', 'loud', 'park', 'may', 'difficult', 'restaur', 'busi', 'pack', 'also', 'countri', 'store', 'side', 'could', 'buy', 'sauc', 'beef', 'cook']

I ordered asparagus and a cesar salad. The sauce they served with it was way too salty for me. I ate the brisket with the BBQ sauce on the table. The brisket was okay but dry for me. My grandmother ordered ribs, the St Louis ribs which have more fat than meat on them and the waitress failed to let her know that. We didn't get a refill on our water during our visit. The waitress barely checked up on us. The manager came over and asked if everything was okay and we informed her about the ribs and she said we could pick a desert of our choice for the inconvenience. Very kind of her, but the waitress came back with a nasty attitude. The food was okay and the service was not great. - again I'm used to Texas BBQ so yes my opinion is biased.

We ate in the section where it is first come first serve. For the dining area you have to have a reservation in order to sit and eat, no exceptions. We ordered the nachos ($14) and steam buns ($14). The nachos were very filling but good, basically chips with cheese, green onion, and bacon loaded on top. The sticky buns were good too, they had a type of brisket inside with veggies. One of them was a little soggy the bottom. We were celebrating my sister's birthday and our waiter, Hannah, brought her a birthday surprise, a ice cream sundae. Very nice of her.

We started with guacamole which was ok... not the best I have had but had decent flavor. You can tell it was homemade but the flavor was more salty\/oniony rather than creamy avocado with some lime. 

They mentioned they were out of homemade chips but then made some out of the tortilla's they had. These were LOADED with salt and I think they knew it so they comped the guacamoles and chips app. This was a nice gesture and we appreciated it.  

The queso dip was not the best. It was grainy and didnt have that velvety texture or cheesy flavor that I am normally used to with queso. I wouldnt recommend. 

I ordered the chicken milanese torta. Now I have had many authentic torta's and this WAS NOT A TORTA. This is a chicken milanese sandwich. A torta has a special kind of combination of ingredients and this wasnt it. I will say this was a very good sandwich but definitely should not be classified as a torta. Not sure if it is a play on words.

The tacos were the best part of the night. The mahi taco was fresh and the combination of flavors worked well. The other tacos were similarly delicious.

I wasnt the biggest fan of how they served them because no one really knew which ones were which and when we did it was awkward getting them from the big tray to our plates.

The drinks were solid and i would recommend the margarita's. Solid place to have a drink and the decor was also modern and cool. The crowd gave it a good vibe and I could definitely see myself hanging out here if I am in the area again.

It's a very casual place that caters to convenience of being right there and serves trendy and upscale Americanized Asian bistro. Of course, like most of these hotel restaurants, it prices itself way high and makes you think you're getting a better experience than you really are getting. The service is decent, not great, but decent. 

On my two visits, I ordered the Pad Thai noodles with pot sticker dim sum and Hor Fun with Satay Chicken. Being a Thai food aficionado, there was something a bit odd about the Pad Thai, almost a sickly sweet taste to it. The pot stickers were not exceptionally noteworthy. The Hor Fun was the best dish I ordered. The Satay Chicken was good, but it's pretty hard to screw that dish up.

I applaud them for giving correct portion sizes. They do not dump a truckload of food on a plate. It's a respectable serving size without making you feel like a glutton for finishing your bowl. The service was a bit sketchy. Not awful, but not great. My waitress just had the attitude of ""what do you want to eat,"" not ""can I answer any questions you might have?"" 

Overpriced, yes. Underwhelming, no. If you find yourself in a pinch like I did, needing to grab a bite to eat while on a break, Noodles is a good choice.

The manager personally came out to apologize to us and offered us drinks and dessert on the house for the entire evening. I've been to plenty of places where they sort of shaft you on the amount of alcohol - not here. I ordered a Jack & Coke with a lime wedge to start off with and the bartender, on his own, made it with Gentleman Jack and it was stiff to say the least. Nice crushed ice served in a very unique high ball glass. All night long, they made sure that a fresh high ball glass of our drinks were following as soon as one was empty. 

With what I thought was a proper handling of the table situation, we waited for our table to open, sipping drinks and admiring the scenery. Once seated, we ordered the Port Judith Calimari and the seared yellowfin tuna for starters. Both were outstanding. I'm a harsh judge of calimari and Emeril's did not disappoint. Still not the best I've ever had, but definitely up there. I ordered the pecan crusted Texas redfish, pepper jack potato rosti, creole meuniere sauce and grilled vegetable ratatouille. It was absolutely delicious. The smash across the face you received from the melody of flavors was incredible. I don't recall what my friend ordered but he was raving about it.

For dessert, we were told by our waitress if there is one dessert you must try, it is Emeril's Banana Cream Pie. Words fail to describe how delicious and filling this was. It was served in a nice warm cast iron skillet, with gorgeous chocolate shavings nestled on top.  

The service: top notch. Our waitress was prompt, courteous, full of recommendations and explanations of flavors on each dish, and never far from us. Zero complaints. I never once had to ask for anything - it just appeared. 

The interior décor: well thought out, with a nice earth tone color scheme which is accentuated by a wide variety of brilliant sapphire blues, yellows, purples, reds, and silvers at the bar and around the restaurant. It has a very trendy, but authentic New Orleans flare to it. The bar at the center has a nice feel to it, with nicely back lit liquor shelves to showcase Emeril's offerings. There is a ridiculous amount of wine racks all around the exterior of the restaurant, giving patrons quite the selection from which to choose.

The price: frankly, I thought the prices on the menu were fair for the caliber of restaurant such as Emeril's in a city like Vegas. My entrée was $28, and when I got the bill, much to my surprise, the manager had also comped our appetizers. So all we ended up paying for was our entrées. Really, that is going above and beyond to correct a mistake.

The manager paid us a visit once at the end of our meal to ask how everything was, apologizing once again for the delay, and asking us if we would come back. The answer was a resounding yes. We thanked him for his hospitality and his drive to make our visit the best it could be.

I am sure sorry if Emeril's at the MGM Grand has gone downhill since I visited a few years back. But I stand by my review. When I was there, they treated us incredibly well and made a faux pax on their part with our reservation right."	3	0	1	['im', 'review', 'emeril', 'mgm', 'grand', 'year', 'ago', 'look', 'like', 'base', 'upon', 'review', 'yelper', 'gone', 'hill', 'that', 'shame', 'experi', 'fantasticw', 'pm', 'reserv', 'made', 'month', 'advanc', 'wait', 'minut', 'arriv', 'manag', 'person', 'came', 'apolog', 'us', 'offer', 'us', 'drink', 'dessert', 'hous', 'entir', 'even', 'ive', 'plenti', 'place', 'sort', 'shaft', 'amount', 'alcohol', 'order', 'jack', 'coke', 'lime', 'wedg', 'start', 'bartend', 'made', 'gentleman', 'jack', 'stiff', 'say', 'least', 'nice', 'crush', 'ice', 'serv', 'uniqu', 'high', 'ball', 'glass', 'night', 'long', 'made', 'sure', 'fresh', 'high', 'ball', 'glass', 'drink', 'follow', 'soon', 'one', 'empti', 'thought', 'proper', 'handl', 'tabl', 'situat', 'wait', 'tabl', 'open', 'sip', 'drink', 'admir', 'sceneri', 'seat', 'order', 'port', 'judith', 'calimari', 'sear', 'yellowfin', 'tuna', 'starter', 'outstand', 'im', 'harsh', 'judg', 'calimari', 'emeril', 'disappoint', 'still', 'best', 'ive', 'ever', 'definit', 'order', 'pecan', 'crust', 'texa', 'redfish', 'pepper', 'jack', 'potato', 'rosti', 'creol', 'meunier', 'sauc', 'grill', 'veget', 'ratatouil', 'absolut', 'delici', 'smash', 'across', 'face', 'receiv', 'melodi', 'flavor', 'incred', 'dont', 'recal', 'friend', 'order', 'rave', 'itfor', 'dessert', 'told', 'waitress', 'one', 'dessert', 'must', 'tri', 'emeril', 'banana', 'cream', 'pie', 'word', 'fail', 'describ', 'delici', 'fill', 'serv', 'nice', 'warm', 'cast', 'iron', 'skillet', 'gorgeou', 'chocol', 'shave', 'nestl', 'top', 'servic', 'top', 'notch', 'waitress', 'prompt', 'courteou', 'full', 'recommend', 'explan', 'flavor', 'dish', 'never', 'far', 'us', 'zero', 'complaint', 'never', 'ask', 'anyth', 'appear', 'interior', 'dcor', 'well', 'thought', 'nice', 'earth', 'tone', 'color', 'scheme', 'accentu', 'wide', 'varieti', 'brilliant', 'sapphir', 'blue', 'yellow', 'purpl', 'red', 'silver', 'bar', 'around', 'restaur', 'trendi', 'authent', 'new', 'orlean', 'flare', 'bar', 'center', 'nice', 'feel', 'nice', 'back', 'lit', 'liquor', 'shelv', 'showcas', 'emeril', 'offer', 'ridicul', 'amount', 'wine', 'rack', 'around', 'exterior', 'restaur', 'give', 'patron', 'quit', 'select', 'chooseth', 'price', 'frankli', 'thought', 'price', 'menu', 'fair', 'calib', 'restaur', 'emeril', 'citi', 'like', 'vega', 'entr', 'got', 'bill', 'much', 'surpris', 'manag', 'also', 'comp', 'appet', 'end', 'pay', 'entr', 'realli', 'go', 'beyond', 'correct', 'mistaketh', 'manag', 'paid', 'us', 'visit', 'end', 'meal', 'ask', 'everyth', 'apolog', 'delay', 'ask', 'us', 'would', 'come', 'back', 'answer', 'resound', 'ye', 'thank', 'hospit', 'drive', 'make', 'visit', 'best', 'could', 'bei', 'sure', 'sorri', 'emeril', 'mgm', 'grand', 'gone', 'downhil', 'sinc', 'visit', 'year', 'back', 'stand', 'review', 'treat', 'us', 'incred', 'well', 'made', 'faux', 'pax', 'part', 'reserv', 'right']

The annoying thing for me was their wi-fi is extremely sketchy in the airport. I really needed to access some documents on my laptop waiting for my flight and was sitting at Appropos in the F gate area. When I asked the waitress why I can't get on the wi-fi, she responded that ""oh yeah this side of the airport doesn't get good wi-fi."" What? Are you kidding me? You are at a major international airport for crying out loud and you can't provide even a basic wi-fi connection? I'm not asking for speed, I'm merely asking for a connection. The iPads at each area are a very classy touch, and the food\/drinks at the above mentioned restaurant by the gate were top notch. The gates themselves were deficient in seating area, so most passengers lined up to sit on the edge of the people mover.

Customs coming in to Toronto were amongst the nicest and easiest I've ever had to deal with - even giving service with a smile which is unheard of anywhere else. I guess  the Canadians live up to their pleasant and friendly stereotype, even at customs. Returning back to the US, the customs checkpoint was pretty slow and unfriendly, but uneventful. 

The airport was well laid out, and very clean.

It's a pretty well laid out airport, and making connectors is pretty much a snap because of the super fast people movers that wisp you away to this and that gate area. 

I was there not too long ago and had an early morning 1.5 hour layover. Ate at a typical Tex-Mex place that served chorizo and scrambled eggs. Quite tasty and I like how they mix in plenty of restaurants around the gate areas. 

It's a big and busy airport, but navigating it is very straight forward. If I'm heading out West, this is an airport that I don't mind hanging in if I have to have a layover. It features free wi-fi that seemed to work wherever I went. The airport and it's bathrooms are very clean and well maintained. 

A word to the wise: if you are running a low battery on your electronic devices, you're better off sitting down at a restaurant and trying to find a wall outlet to mooch power from than you are trying to find an available outlet at the gate area. They are few and far between at the gates and you can almost rest assured someone has beaten you to the punch in using it. So I usually go into a restaurant, scope out an outlet near a table or a booth, sit down and use that. Of course, just to be courteous, I'll order something to eat to make it fair. I haven't had to go through the TSA checkpoint since I only land there to connect elsewhere, so I can't comment on that fun experience."	0	0	1	['ive', 'flown', 'sky', 'harbor', 'mani', 'time', 'pretti', 'well', 'laid', 'airport', 'make', 'connector', 'pretti', 'much', 'snap', 'super', 'fast', 'peopl', 'mover', 'wisp', 'away', 'gate', 'area', 'long', 'ago', 'earli', 'morn', 'hour', 'layov', 'ate', 'typic', 'texmex', 'place', 'serv', 'chorizo', 'scrambl', 'egg', 'quit', 'tasti', 'like', 'mix', 'plenti', 'restaur', 'around', 'gate', 'area', 'big', 'busi', 'airport', 'navig', 'straight', 'forward', 'im', 'head', 'west', 'airport', 'dont', 'mind', 'hang', 'layov', 'featur', 'free', 'wifi', 'seem', 'work', 'wherev', 'went', 'airport', 'bathroom', 'clean', 'well', 'maintain', 'word', 'wise', 'run', 'low', 'batteri', 'electron', 'devic', 'your', 'better', 'sit', 'restaur', 'tri', 'find', 'wall', 'outlet', 'mooch', 'power', 'tri', 'find', 'avail', 'outlet', 'gate', 'area', 'far', 'gate', 'almost', 'rest', 'assur', 'someon', 'beaten', 'punch', 'use', 'usual', 'go', 'restaur', 'scope', 'outlet', 'near', 'tabl', 'booth', 'sit', 'use', 'cours', 'courteou', 'ill', 'order', 'someth', 'eat', 'make', 'fair', 'havent', 'go', 'tsa', 'checkpoint', 'sinc', 'land', 'connect', 'elsewher', 'cant', 'comment', 'fun', 'experi']

I love the blue sky and clouds mural on the ceilings and the light effects they do to mimic day light. The casino floor is nice, but I think Paris thinks a bit too highly of themselves because their table minimums were awfully high, and their poker tourneys were set at buy-ins that were so high that they were only filling half of the field.

However, Paris does have one little thing that sets it apart from every other place on the Strip: their breakfast buffet. This breakfast spread they have, set in a Parisian village theme, is absolutely out of control. I have never in my life seen so many different options on a breakfast buffet. At $30\/person, it's steep, but it is an experience you'll never forget. In the ""you're not going to believe this just happened to me"" Vegas-story fashion, my buddy and I are standing in this incredibly long line waiting to pay our $30 each and these two incredibly cute girls walk out of the buffet area and headed over to us. They asked us if we'd like two free coupons for the buffet; of course we took them graciously and chatted for just a minute. They had to go to the airport and weren't going to be in town to use them. They informed us we didn't have to wait in line, we could just walk in -- and walk in we did. Certain things in life are just perpetual game-changers, and Paris' breakfast buffet is one of them.

Everything you ever wanted or could dream of wanting for breakfast was there. Since that experience, it's been a tradition that every time I'm in town, I go to Paris for breakfast only. They can keep the gaming and sell that to the tourists. If I want to game, I'll go to the MGM, Rio, Caesars or the Bellagio. In fact, Paris could just close its casino as far as I'm concerned and keep the breakfast buffet open. This is also where my nickname ""Bullmoose"" originated, so it's been a great story to tell!"	0	0	0	['ive', 'never', 'stay', 'pari', 'la', 'vega', 'spent', 'fair', 'amount', 'time', 'game', 'love', 'blue', 'sky', 'cloud', 'mural', 'ceil', 'light', 'effect', 'mimic', 'day', 'light', 'casino', 'floor', 'nice', 'think', 'pari', 'think', 'bit', 'highli', 'tabl', 'minimum', 'aw', 'high', 'poker', 'tourney', 'set', 'buyin', 'high', 'fill', 'half', 'fieldhowev', 'pari', 'one', 'littl', 'thing', 'set', 'apart', 'everi', 'place', 'strip', 'breakfast', 'buffet', 'breakfast', 'spread', 'set', 'parisian', 'villag', 'theme', 'absolut', 'control', 'never', 'life', 'seen', 'mani', 'differ', 'option', 'breakfast', 'buffet', 'person', 'steep', 'experi', 'youll', 'never', 'forget', 'your', 'go', 'believ', 'happen', 'vegasstori', 'fashion', 'buddi', 'stand', 'incred', 'long', 'line', 'wait', 'pay', 'two', 'incred', 'cute', 'girl', 'walk', 'buffet', 'area', 'head', 'us', 'ask', 'us', 'wed', 'like', 'two', 'free', 'coupon', 'buffet', 'cours', 'took', 'gracious', 'chat', 'minut', 'go', 'airport', 'werent', 'go', 'town', 'use', 'inform', 'us', 'didnt', 'wait', 'line', 'could', 'walk', 'walk', 'certain', 'thing', 'life', 'perpetu', 'gamechang', 'pari', 'breakfast', 'buffet', 'one', 'themeveryth', 'ever', 'want', 'could', 'dream', 'want', 'breakfast', 'sinc', 'experi', 'tradit', 'everi', 'time', 'im', 'town', 'go', 'pari', 'breakfast', 'keep', 'game', 'sell', 'tourist', 'want', 'game', 'ill', 'go', 'mgm', 'rio', 'caesar', 'bellagio', 'fact', 'pari', 'could', 'close', 'casino', 'far', 'im', 'concern', 'keep', 'breakfast', 'buffet', 'open', 'also', 'nicknam', 'bullmoos', 'origin', 'great', 'stori', 'tell']

If you want action, MGM is hopping 24\/7 with action. The casino is so huge that I still haven't seen all of the 170,000+ square feet of gaming area. MGM sort of bridges the gap between a great casino and a great resort. It ties both in with a proper attention given to both. You can find very reasonable rates per night there. It's conveniently located at the South end of the strip, so coming from McCarron International, your cab fees will be light. When you pull up to the MGM, you can just sense the rich history of this place. The epic pay-per-view boxing matches, the world-renowned shows, the great concerts, etc. When the sign says ""The City of Entertainment,"" you have no problem believing it. The lobby is a beautiful marble with the MGM lion front and center. It is a grand entrance, which is both breathtaking and elegant. 

From a gaming perspective, I love that the MGM connects both low rollers and high rollers and doesn't discriminate their table offerings based upon a crowd they're trying to attract, such as The Wynn, The Bellagio, or the Venetian. You can easily still find $5 blackjack tables there, and of course, the $100 tables are always available. The mid-range rooms are very nice. The beds are super comfortable, nice blackout curtains in the afternoon to block out that intense summer time sun. The bathrooms are spacious and luxuriously appointed. 

Of all the casinos I've visited, the dealers at the MGM have been by far the most cool, down-to-earth, fun, funny and engaged. The casino has many restaurants, including Emeril's, there are day spas, pool and beach area for the kids, and nice shops if that's your thing.

I can't think of a better place if you've never been to Vegas and want the experience without laying down a boatload of cash to get it. I will always rotate MGM into my stays in Vegas. It was my first and will always hold a special place in my heart."	1	1	1	['mgm', 'grand', 'first', 'experi', 'stay', 'la', 'vega', 'say', 'first', 'time', 'didnt', 'disappointif', 'want', 'action', 'mgm', 'hop', 'action', 'casino', 'huge', 'still', 'havent', 'seen', 'squar', 'feet', 'game', 'area', 'mgm', 'sort', 'bridg', 'gap', 'great', 'casino', 'great', 'resort', 'tie', 'proper', 'attent', 'given', 'find', 'reason', 'rate', 'per', 'night', 'conveni', 'locat', 'south', 'end', 'strip', 'come', 'mccarron', 'intern', 'cab', 'fee', 'light', 'pull', 'mgm', 'sens', 'rich', 'histori', 'place', 'epic', 'payperview', 'box', 'match', 'worldrenown', 'show', 'great', 'concert', 'etc', 'sign', 'say', 'citi', 'entertain', 'problem', 'believ', 'lobbi', 'beauti', 'marbl', 'mgm', 'lion', 'front', 'center', 'grand', 'entranc', 'breathtak', 'eleg', 'game', 'perspect', 'love', 'mgm', 'connect', 'low', 'roller', 'high', 'roller', 'doesnt', 'discrimin', 'tabl', 'offer', 'base', 'upon', 'crowd', 'theyr', 'tri', 'attract', 'wynn', 'bellagio', 'venetian', 'easili', 'still', 'find', 'blackjack', 'tabl', 'cours', 'tabl', 'alway', 'avail', 'midrang', 'room', 'nice', 'bed', 'super', 'comfort', 'nice', 'blackout', 'curtain', 'afternoon', 'block', 'intens', 'summer', 'time', 'sun', 'bathroom', 'spaciou', 'luxuri', 'appoint', 'casino', 'ive', 'visit', 'dealer', 'mgm', 'far', 'cool', 'downtoearth', 'fun', 'funni', 'engag', 'casino', 'mani', 'restaur', 'includ', 'emeril', 'day', 'spa', 'pool', 'beach', 'area', 'kid', 'nice', 'shop', 'that', 'thingi', 'cant', 'think', 'better', 'place', 'youv', 'never', 'vega', 'want', 'experi', 'without', 'lay', 'boatload', 'cash', 'get', 'alway', 'rotat', 'mgm', 'stay', 'vega', 'first', 'alway', 'hold', 'special', 'place', 'heart']

I had the fortune of a friend treating me to the stay while we were in town for the WSOP. From the moment we walked in, it was clear that this was a masterpiece of Las Vegas. The feel, the atmosphere, everything was first class. The hand blown glass tulips in the lobby are breathtaking. There is an air of classiness to this place that seems lacking in other casinos (not all of them) on the strip. Bellagio feels like it runs at a slower, more deliberate pace. The staff were first class and very professional. 

The room itself made you want to stay and appreciate it. Everything from the fully stocked wet bar, to the view, to the absolutely gorgeous bathroom with steam shower and hot tub, to the most comfortable beds just made the Bellagio steal the show. The view of the strip is awesome. There is so much to do in the hotel\/casino that you could really just stay there; lots of high end shops, restaurants, salon & day spa, etc. can fill your day with activities.

Fortunately, I had been to Vegas twice prior to staying here so I could justify just hanging out and taking in as much as I could. Everything about the Bellagio is just dripping with elegance. I know that now, it is considered one of the ""older"" hotels on the strip, but that does not make it any less appealing. At night time, it is always an experience to go take in one of the fountain shows. 

Yeah, it's pricey, but it's doable if you're visiting off-season and work your magic on the internet to book a room with them. The room service is flawless. 

On the casino floor, they are very aggressive to make sure you have drinks while you are gaming and even if you are not. I came down the elevators early one morning around 5:45am to grab a newspaper and a coffee. A very attractive young waitress approached me as I walked out of and asked me if she could get me a drink. I told her I was just looking for some coffee and a newspaper. She told me she would go get me one and asked me if I would like Bailey's with it, to which I happily accepted. I wandered over and grabbed a newspaper, and she was waiting for me with not one, but two cups of coffee with lids on them.

Bellagio will always hold a special place in my heart. Great memories and I hope to be back one day. Without hesitation, 5 stars."	5	0	0	['year', 'went', 'bellagio', 'thee', 'place', 'stay', 'vega', 'fortun', 'friend', 'treat', 'stay', 'town', 'wsop', 'moment', 'walk', 'clear', 'masterpiec', 'la', 'vega', 'feel', 'atmospher', 'everyth', 'first', 'class', 'hand', 'blown', 'glass', 'tulip', 'lobbi', 'breathtak', 'air', 'classi', 'place', 'seem', 'lack', 'casino', 'strip', 'bellagio', 'feel', 'like', 'run', 'slower', 'deliber', 'pace', 'staff', 'first', 'class', 'profession', 'room', 'made', 'want', 'stay', 'appreci', 'everyth', 'fulli', 'stock', 'wet', 'bar', 'view', 'absolut', 'gorgeou', 'bathroom', 'steam', 'shower', 'hot', 'tub', 'comfort', 'bed', 'made', 'bellagio', 'steal', 'show', 'view', 'strip', 'awesom', 'much', 'hotelcasino', 'could', 'realli', 'stay', 'lot', 'high', 'end', 'shop', 'restaur', 'salon', 'day', 'spa', 'etc', 'fill', 'day', 'activitiesfortun', 'vega', 'twice', 'prior', 'stay', 'could', 'justifi', 'hang', 'take', 'much', 'could', 'everyth', 'bellagio', 'drip', 'eleg', 'know', 'consid', 'one', 'older', 'hotel', 'strip', 'make', 'less', 'appeal', 'night', 'time', 'alway', 'experi', 'go', 'take', 'one', 'fountain', 'show', 'yeah', 'pricey', 'doabl', 'your', 'visit', 'offseason', 'work', 'magic', 'internet', 'book', 'room', 'room', 'servic', 'flawless', 'casino', 'floor', 'aggress', 'make', 'sure', 'drink', 'game', 'even', 'came', 'elev', 'earli', 'one', 'morn', 'around', 'grab', 'newspap', 'coffe', 'attract', 'young', 'waitress', 'approach', 'walk', 'ask', 'could', 'get', 'drink', 'told', 'look', 'coffe', 'newspap', 'told', 'would', 'go', 'get', 'one', 'ask', 'would', 'like', 'bailey', 'happili', 'accept', 'wander', 'grab', 'newspap', 'wait', 'one', 'two', 'cup', 'coffe', 'lid', 'thembellagio', 'alway', 'hold', 'special', 'place', 'heart', 'great', 'memori', 'hope', 'back', 'one', 'day', 'without', 'hesit', 'star']

You walk into the place and it is dripping with elegance and very worthy of its 5 diamond rating. There's so much to do in this place that it is a vacation in and of itself. I think it's fitting that this place stands where the Sands used to stand. The Sands in its heyday was the height of class, and the Venetian proudly carries that torch.

They spent a tremendous amount of time, research, architectural detail, and of course money to make this place what it is. I've gamed there many times and what stood out to me was how nice and friendly everyone was, right down to the pit bosses. 

The only thing that keeps me from staying there is that constant incense smell that is overpowering when you walk in. Yes, it smells nice, but it dries my eyes out and stuffs my nose up, so I've always defaulted to choosing the Bellagio over the Venetian.

I went to the concierge to ask for a great  Italian restaurant for lunch.  Unfortunately concierge recommended a restaurant they haven't eaten because the food was horrible you can read it from my other review Dal Toro, don't go there please. 

I went back to concierge after lunch to ask where can we sit since we are waiting to check in and it's not 3pm yet.  A lady told me there is no sitting area, we have to go to a cafe.  I thought this is odd, a big hotel like this no seating area. I can't bring my kid to the gaming area, this is why I need a place for her. I found at least 3 areas on my own, thanks for nothing... 

I got to my room, the cheese crumbs was still on the couch.  My hubby is nice enough to clean.  We had to wait 2 hrs for our luggage from the bell boys. REALLY!!! My husband had to call to ask them about it. 

We ended up sleeping in a comforter that was wrapped with a fitted sheet, which means no comforter cover and no sheets. We got hot at night and realized there was no sheets... The next day I asked a house keeper is it normal they don't provide sheets for the bed. It turns out my room wasn't clean.  Oh great mind you I took a bath and used the bathroom too. Now I am really disgusted.  

The housekeeper told me he will talk to the manager for me. They offer to clean my room ASAP. It turns out the room was clean and the new sheets had stains on it. 

I had it and went to the front desk and told an associate of my dilemmas with the hotel. She apologized and comp me $75.  Really for how much crap I endured with my family $75 should be fine. I didn't really care at this point, I will never go back. 

The next house keeper changed the sheets and told me she couldn't give me new wine glasses and that I have to call priority desk. OMG! 

The rest of the time the guests that stay here are nicer than the staff.  The guests would  greet each other, but the staff don't greet you even when you talk to them.  It's like your inconveniencing them!!!

The hotel is beautiful.  Next time I will only stay at the Wynn."	0	2	0	['begin', 'stay', 'last', 'week', 'vacat', 'expect', 'servic', 'peopl', 'worth', 'price', 'idea', 'custom', 'servic', 'mean', 'front', 'desk', 'unfortun', 'werent', 'front', 'desk', 'would', 'give', 'star', 'onlyi', 'went', 'concierg', 'ask', 'great', 'italian', 'restaur', 'lunch', 'unfortun', 'concierg', 'recommend', 'restaur', 'havent', 'eaten', 'food', 'horribl', 'read', 'review', 'dal', 'toro', 'dont', 'go', 'pleas', 'went', 'back', 'concierg', 'lunch', 'ask', 'sit', 'sinc', 'wait', 'check', 'pm', 'yet', 'ladi', 'told', 'sit', 'area', 'go', 'cafe', 'thought', 'odd', 'big', 'hotel', 'like', 'seat', 'area', 'cant', 'bring', 'kid', 'game', 'area', 'need', 'place', 'found', 'least', 'area', 'thank', 'noth', 'got', 'room', 'chees', 'crumb', 'still', 'couch', 'hubbi', 'nice', 'enough', 'clean', 'wait', 'hr', 'luggag', 'bell', 'boy', 'realli', 'husband', 'call', 'ask', 'end', 'sleep', 'comfort', 'wrap', 'fit', 'sheet', 'mean', 'comfort', 'cover', 'sheet', 'got', 'hot', 'night', 'realiz', 'sheet', 'next', 'day', 'ask', 'hous', 'keeper', 'normal', 'dont', 'provid', 'sheet', 'bed', 'turn', 'room', 'wasnt', 'clean', 'oh', 'great', 'mind', 'took', 'bath', 'use', 'bathroom', 'realli', 'disgust', 'housekeep', 'told', 'talk', 'manag', 'offer', 'clean', 'room', 'asap', 'turn', 'room', 'clean', 'new', 'sheet', 'stain', 'went', 'front', 'desk', 'told', 'associ', 'dilemma', 'hotel', 'apolog', 'comp', 'realli', 'much', 'crap', 'endur', 'famili', 'fine', 'didnt', 'realli', 'care', 'point', 'never', 'go', 'back', 'next', 'hous', 'keeper', 'chang', 'sheet', 'told', 'couldnt', 'give', 'new', 'wine', 'glass', 'call', 'prioriti', 'desk', 'omg', 'rest', 'time', 'guest', 'stay', 'nicer', 'staff', 'guest', 'would', 'greet', 'staff', 'dont', 'greet', 'even', 'talk', 'like', 'inconvenienc', 'themth', 'hotel', 'beauti', 'next', 'time', 'stay', 'wynn']

We rented two rooms and to begin with the carpets were filthy in the room and hallways, one room the sofa a ripped lining which hung on the floor. The alarm clock made this really weird humming noise and I had to unplug the makeup mirror was broken and had no light as well as the base was broken so it listed to one side. When you flushed the toilet the outside sink gurgled for a few minutes. I asked for two non-smoking rooms and one stunk of cigarette smoke.

I stayed at the Rio for three days and one of my rooms was not cleaned for two consecutive days. When I called housekeeping they tried to say that we were in the room too long in the morning but we were up and out by 11AM each day. The Rio has two pools one with a waterfall and another that is heated were kid mainly enough themselves. This pool was absolutely disgusting. The white tile had a filthy black ring around it. Once I returned home I completed a survey sent to me by the Rio and I heard nothing but once I posted a review such as this one on Trip Advisor I was contacted by the Total Rewards depart offering me an upgraded room the next time I visited. 

This tells me that they in fact had cleaner and better maintained rooms if you pay extra, otherwise you get filth, no housekeeping services and tattered furniture. I would have to be out of my mind to throw good money behind bad. Keep in mind that the Rio ""All Suites"" Hotel and Casino is owned by Caesars Entertain who also own Caesars Palace, Paris, Bally the Quad and a number of other ""Strip"" properties. It's clear to me that the Rio is there ""Ghetto"" property where they clip poor unsuspecting tourists who are trying to save a few dollars while on vacation. 

Since my return I have done extensive research on this property and the vast majority of the negative reviews are consistent with the property being a poorly maintained dump. Don't believe the glitz and glamour that you see on the Discovery Channel this place truly sucks and management knows about it.

Then again was charged $275 for having a friend over who had their dog so I was fined for the dog! I have had insect issues with Bolero over the past year. First it was roaches, then there were many spiders, earwigs, and bed bugs!!!!! I asked the leasing office to please switch my apartment and then came the fees! Along with the audacity to insist I would be taking bed bugs with me to another apartment. My parking spot is way across from my apartment. So many people who do not even live here park in our parking spots. DO NOT SIGN YOUR LEASE AT BOLERO!!!!!! I love giving great compliments but this apartment complex deserves none!!!!	1	0	0	['far', 'worst', 'apart', 'complex', 'fool', 'outsid', 'first', 'apart', 'want', 'move', 'home', 'call', 'manag', 'sarah', 'rude', 'care', 'concern', 'resid', 'everyth', 'money', 'bolero', 'charg', 'everyth', 'fine', 'ashtray', 'door', 'charg', 'friend', 'dog', 'fine', 'dog', 'insect', 'issu', 'bolero', 'past', 'year', 'first', 'roach', 'mani', 'spider', 'earwig', 'bed', 'bug', 'ask', 'leas', 'offic', 'pleas', 'switch', 'apart', 'came', 'fee', 'along', 'audac', 'insist', 'would', 'take', 'bed', 'bug', 'anoth', 'apart', 'park', 'spot', 'way', 'across', 'apart', 'mani', 'peopl', 'even', 'live', 'park', 'park', 'spot', 'sign', 'leas', 'bolero', 'love', 'give', 'great', 'compliment', 'apart', 'complex', 'deserv', 'none']

Alors, j'ai adoré...tellement que je suis allé 2 fois en 10 jours...! Les assiettes tournent autour de 11 à 14$ pour la majorité..bien-sûre il y en a des plus fancy et plus dispendieuses...et des assiettes de tacos seulement moins cher! La place est simple et coloré et c'est tant mieux comme ça! Il y a un petit marché dans le resto avec des produits mexicains. On retrouve aussi 3 pâtisseries à la caisse...entre autre des Churros...que j'ai trouvé so so..les deux fois...mais ça reste bon et fullll de dulce de leche. 

Je vous conseille la Sopa de tortilla. Peut-être pas la meilleur au monde...mais du moins une des bonnes à Mtl. La première fois, j'ai pris le plat du jour qui était tostada de ceviche..yummy le plat à 11$. La deuxième fois, j'ai pris des crevettes à l'ail. Excellent choix. Presque toutes les assiettes viennent avec du guacamole, du riz et de la salade. Ahhh et on vous apporte des tortillas  colorées avec 3 sortes de sauces en attendant le plat. Le service est très rapide et ils ont une terrasse avec la vue sur le marché Jean-Talon."	1	1	1	['avi', 'dj', 'aston', 'besoin', 'dajout', 'un', 'ime', 'avi', 'ouiii', 'alor', 'jai', 'adortel', 'que', 'je', 'sui', 'foi', 'en', 'jour', 'le', 'assiett', 'tournent', 'autour', 'de', 'pour', 'la', 'majoritbiensr', 'il', 'en', 'de', 'plu', 'fanci', 'et', 'plu', 'dispendieuseset', 'de', 'assiett', 'de', 'taco', 'seulement', 'moin', 'cher', 'la', 'place', 'est', 'simpl', 'et', 'color', 'et', 'cest', 'tant', 'mieux', 'comm', 'il', 'un', 'petit', 'march', 'dan', 'le', 'resto', 'avec', 'de', 'produit', 'mexicain', 'retrouv', 'aussi', 'ptisseri', 'la', 'caisseentr', 'autr', 'de', 'churrosqu', 'jai', 'trouv', 'sole', 'deux', 'foismai', 'rest', 'bon', 'et', 'fullll', 'de', 'dulc', 'de', 'lech', 'je', 'vou', 'conseil', 'la', 'sopa', 'de', 'tortilla', 'peuttr', 'pa', 'la', 'meilleur', 'au', 'mondemai', 'du', 'moin', 'une', 'de', 'bonn', 'mtl', 'la', 'premir', 'foi', 'jai', 'pri', 'le', 'plat', 'du', 'jour', 'qui', 'tait', 'tostada', 'de', 'cevicheyummi', 'le', 'plat', 'la', 'deuxim', 'foi', 'jai', 'pri', 'de', 'crevett', 'lail', 'excel', 'choix', 'presqu', 'tout', 'le', 'assiett', 'viennent', 'avec', 'du', 'guacamol', 'du', 'riz', 'et', 'de', 'la', 'salad', 'ahhh', 'et', 'vou', 'apport', 'de', 'tortilla', 'color', 'avec', 'sort', 'de', 'sauc', 'en', 'attend', 'le', 'plat', 'le', 'servic', 'est', 'tr', 'rapid', 'et', 'il', 'ont', 'une', 'terrass', 'avec', 'la', 'vue', 'sur', 'le', 'march', 'jeantalon']

Des crevettes, une bonne salade cesar, salade de fruit de mer, légumes, salades variées. Je n'ai malheureusement pas vu de homard ou du crabe. Peut être qu'il y en a pas en début de semaine et c'est pour cela que c'est moins cher?? Bref, les plats chaud j'ai été déçu. Il manquait un peu de variété. Au menu: Roti de boeuf , poulet, purée de pommes de terres,  Pommes de terres. Saumon Crevettes.riz. saumon crevettes pâtes et c'est environs ca que je me souviensm  Pâtes (une sorte) à éviter pas de goût et trop cuites. J'ai adoré le saumon et le sauté au crevettes.

Par chance, L'gros luxe est devant la jolie Place Roy et à côté d'une épicerie. On peut donc bien attendre dans ce parc sans problème, car nous donnons notre nom à un employé du resto et il nous appelle quand la table est prête :) 

Donc, après une heure qui a passé bien vite, nous sommes assise et commandons à boire et à manger. Je ne suis pas très cocktail, donc je me suis pris une bière L'Gros Luxe. 26oz. C'est gros, c'est de la Pabst, mais c'est 6$ .On se commande les fameuses frites d'avocats. C'EST BON, C'EST GRAS, ON AIME ÇA. Puis les tacos de poissons et Porc effilochés arrivent. Wow des gros tacos! 2 dans l'assiettes pour 6$. Et pour être santé la salade de betterave et fromage de chèvre sur roquette, YUMMY, toujours un plat à 6$ et pas un petit bol, une grosse salade!. 

Bref, ça vaut la peine pour le prix! Je constate dans le menu que les végétariens vont être comblé, car il y a quand même du choix! Les drinks ne sont pas super cher non plus. 

Bref, j'y retourne bien sûre, par contre de ce que j'ai constaté, je ne crois pas que ça soit adapté à un gros groupe, vous allez être tassé. Mais sinon super, et la place est ben ben cute. Le service aussi super rapide. Personnel très aimable.

Dîner de groupe entre collègues. Nous étions environs 25. Oui 25 c'est vraiment beaucoup...mais quand le restaurant n'a que 8 autres clients....Ils ont un menu très variées le midi, incluant soupe et café. La plupart des plats viennent avec salade et frites ou riz.

Quand je suis arrivé il y avait une dizaine de personne qui étaient déjà assi à notre table. Nous sommes arrivés (nous etions 5) et ensuite deux autres groupes de 5 qui sont arrivée, environs 5-10 minutes plus tard..Imaginez-vous que le serveur a été voir ceux qui sont arrivé après nous. Ils ont même eu leur soupe avant de venir de voir, et les gens qui étaient déjà la se fesait servir le repas principal. Je comprends ils sont arrivés avant, mais au moins nous dire que ce ne sera pas long ou qu'il s'en vient...mais non..

Le serveur est finalement arrivé, nous et un autre collegue avons commandé une bière. Nous l'avons reçu après la soupe en entrée. Un oeu long pour une simple bière, nous avons même du lui repéter. J'ai commandé un wrap au poulet avec du riz mexicain, j'ai bien aimé. Par contre, il fallait fouillé dans la salade pour trouver la vinaigrette. Le service de nourriture à quand même été rapide. Faut préciser qu'il y a comme 5 bussboy qui aide le serveur...

Les autres collègues on reçu leur café et les gens avec qui j'étais assis,  nous avons encore été oublié. On a attendu 10 min pour recevoir la facture, sans qu'il vienne nous voir. Une madame a même été payé au bar, car elle était tanné d'attendre. Je le voulais ce café, car manger du mexicain ça bourre!!! Mais non pas de café....la facture est arrivé. Un de mes collègues m'a dit: ""ils nous ont même pas offert de café... ""

Le serveur a entendue et me dit: ""Vous aviez d'l'air pressée"" Je me suis permis de lui dire...Quand nous attendons 10 min pour une facture, oui on est pressé car notre pause est terminé...

OHHH Malheur....on arrive là...et la caissière.....comment dire...je crois qu'elle détestait sa job où était simplement hyper bête. Malgré toutes les lumières...la moquette des années 80 pour nous impressionner en allant à notre salle....je n'ai pas été renversé par la déco....mais bon sa reste un cinéma....
En 2017...je ne peux pas croire qu'on soit obligé de payer CASH dans un cinéma...en tout cas...

Rendu à la salle...les bancs ARKKEE....vieillissant...inconfortable tsé ils se sont dit qu'un bancs rembourré avec un angle de 90° ça allait être confo pour tout le monde. Watch out la dernière rangée où plusieurs tâches de substance blanche sont visible.... il sont sale en plus de miettes. Peut être qu'ils avaient ramassé les cochonneries laissé par les autres clients mais il y avait encore ben du pop corn à terre. Le 3D m'a donné mal à la tête et l'image n'est pas top clean comparativement à une autre grande chaîne de cinéma qu'on retrouve à Mtl...

J'ai commandé pour manger des ailes de canard...miam délicieux. Cette journée là, un mardi, il y avait une soirée d'humour. Je ne sais pas s'il y avait un manque de staff mais au début la serveuse est venu quand même souvent et ensuite, on m'a oublié :( Ça a pris tellement de temps que j'aurais pu partir sans payer...mais comme je suis honnête, je suis rentrée à l'intérieur.

J'ai adoré leur IPA tropical..quelque chose de même....ça goûtte, comme le nom le dit...LE TROPICAL! Sérieux très bon! L'espace est sombre, mais va avec le mood de la place.

Et ensuite un stand où ils font des jus frais, où bien-sûre nous pouvons y goûter aussi. Entre les gâteaux et les jus, il y a souvent, très souvent des chanteurs ou un petit band de musique de 2-3 personnes et jamais les même. Vive la diversité. Le comptoir à viande est fabuleux surtout pour les bbq l'été il y a du choix et du choix déjà mariné. Tout dans le magasin est bien placé. Le staff est amical.

J'ai été le midi. Le menu est très bien...que ce soit à la carte ou le menu midi. 23$ environs  pour le repas midi, qui inclus un choix d'entrée et le plat principal. Il y a aussi un menu midi dégustation à 40$. Je sais que le menu change quand même  assez souvent...la journée où j'ai été, j'ai pris la salade de betteraves  et chorizo. Petite..très petite, mais excellente!. C'est servi en plus sur un plat qui ressemble à un plat de terre noire.  Très belle présentation! J'ai ensuite décidé de prendre la bavette de boeuf, servi avec légumes et purée et choux fleur.  J'ai bien aimé les légumes et surtout  la purée, la bavette était correct..mais aurait été meilleur si elle avait été saignante comme j'ai demandé...elle était médium saignant. Il n'y avait pas de poivre sur la table, et venant d'un resto un peu plus haut de gamme avec les ingrédients  qu'ils utilisent, on aurait pu  avoir un service de poivre sorti du moulin. 

J'avais tellement faim que j'ai mangé 2 tranches  de pain, qui vient de la boulangerie affilié  La bête  à pain. Le pain avec différentes sortes de graines est délicieux...miam!

Pour le moment j'aurai mis un 4*, par contre...pouet pouet pouet...Le service a fait descendre la note comme ça ne se peut pas.

Après avoir reçu notre première commande, le serveur à changé. Il ne venait jamais nous voir.

J'ai aimé ce spectacle avec la disposition des éléments pour que tous les spectateurs puissent bien voir le spectacle. Par contre, j'ai trouvé que plusieurs numéros se ressemblaient ou n'avaient pas besoin toujours d'être plusieurs pour un numéro où seulement une personne était la vedette.

J'adore la musique, l'ambiance, le confort des sièges, le service à la clientèle. Ce que j'ai moins bien aimé c'est le prix faramineux de la boutique Cirque du Soleil. Je comprends que certains objets sont rares, mais payer 12-16$ pour une tasse..ou 8$ pour un aimant de frigo...j'aime moins.

Rien à voir avec la Place Versaille. On rentre dans une autre categorie de magasins aux Gals d'Anjou. Depuis qu'ils ont fait les travaux de réfection, ajout d'un Simons, du Belle et la Boeuf, le Zibo et plus encore nous n'avons plus besoin de nous rendre au Dix-30 ou à Laval pour avoir le choix de magasinage. J'adore leur section Resto Rapide, le décor est très bien et on a sérieusement envie de manger à chaque fois qu'on passe tout prêt. De plus, ils ont beaucoup de choix de resto rapide. Perso, j'adore Kojax et ils en ont un :D. Sinon, mes magasins préféré et que je trouve différent des autres succursales est le H&M et le Simons. Ils ont un service de vestiaire aussi, qui est super pratique. Il y a aussi des restos et d'autres magasins qui sont connecté mais pas des routes extérieures. Ah oui, ils y ont ajouté un marchéAdonis dans une section de parking :D Je vous conseille d'aller faire un tour, vous allez trouver ce que vous cherchez.	2	0	0	['le', 'galeri', 'danjou', 'cest', 'le', 'centr', 'dachat', 'le', 'plu', 'beau', 'de', 'lest', 'de', 'montral', 'rien', 'voir', 'avec', 'la', 'place', 'versail', 'rentr', 'dan', 'une', 'autr', 'categori', 'de', 'magasin', 'aux', 'gal', 'danjou', 'depui', 'quil', 'ont', 'fait', 'le', 'travaux', 'de', 'rfection', 'ajout', 'dun', 'simon', 'du', 'bell', 'et', 'la', 'boeuf', 'le', 'zibo', 'et', 'plu', 'encor', 'nou', 'navon', 'plu', 'besoin', 'de', 'nou', 'rendr', 'au', 'dix', 'ou', 'laval', 'pour', 'avoir', 'le', 'choix', 'de', 'magasinag', 'jador', 'leur', 'section', 'resto', 'rapid', 'le', 'dcor', 'est', 'tr', 'bien', 'et', 'srieusement', 'envi', 'de', 'manger', 'chaqu', 'foi', 'quon', 'pass', 'tout', 'prt', 'de', 'plu', 'il', 'ont', 'beaucoup', 'de', 'choix', 'de', 'resto', 'rapid', 'perso', 'jador', 'kojax', 'et', 'il', 'en', 'ont', 'un', 'sinon', 'me', 'magasin', 'prfr', 'et', 'que', 'je', 'trouv', 'diffrent', 'de', 'autr', 'succursal', 'est', 'le', 'hm', 'et', 'le', 'simon', 'il', 'ont', 'un', 'servic', 'de', 'vestiair', 'aussi', 'qui', 'est', 'super', 'pratiqu', 'il', 'aussi', 'de', 'resto', 'et', 'dautr', 'magasin', 'qui', 'sont', 'connect', 'mai', 'pa', 'de', 'rout', 'extrieur', 'ah', 'oui', 'il', 'ont', 'ajout', 'un', 'marchadoni', 'dan', 'une', 'section', 'de', 'park', 'je', 'vou', 'conseil', 'daller', 'fair', 'un', 'tour', 'vou', 'allez', 'trouver', 'ce', 'que', 'vou', 'cherchez']

C'est vraiment étonnant le choix qu'ils ont, mais vraiment. Tse un steakk style argentin, du pâté chinois, des pâtes, des pizzas, de la bouffe de casse-croutte, des plats style thai, des mega salades et j'en passe. Bref, il y en a du stock. Si vous y aller le midi, il y a des speciaux du midi avec une dizaine de choix. Mais le soir je vous conseille de prévoir un gros 30 minutes pour faire votre choix. Okey je crois que vous avez compris qu'il y a beaucoup de choix. J'ARRÊTE.

Alors, j'ai pris dans le menu midi express un steak et frite avec sauce Chimi churry. Yummy. Ça venait avec une soupe. J'ai oublié c'était quoi mais elle etait bonne.Mon steak était cuit comme je l'avais demandé et était très bon. J'ai vu les plats de mes collègues et wow ça impressionne. Surtout le pâté chinois et les salades. 

Il y a une jolie terrasse avec vue sur la rue principale du centropolis et du Colosus. Je met un 3*, car le décor est digne d'un resto qui était ""in"" dans les années 80-90.

1. We loved the menu appearing on the Restaurant Week website.  So many interesting entres to choose from that were far different than almost any other restaurant participating.  We have visited Tempest twice before with excellent outcomes, so we booked.
2.  The food was amazing.  My partner had the fried oysters w\/seaweed slaw.  Spectacular, especially the slaw.  I had the lobster bisque w\/flying fish roe.  Similarly tasty.
3. The entres came and were greatly satisfying.  The Marlin had a nice lime aioli.  The pasta had a large portion of different shellfish that were quite delicious.  
4.  Great selections from the desserts offered this week.  It was really hard to choose, and when ours arrived, they were great!
5.  The only glitch was there was no decaf. to order with dessert, but we had enough wine & water to be satisfied.
6.  The serving staff & the hosts were beyond professional.  This group worked together like a well-oiled machine.  Or maybe a well-tuned instrument.

A decision I definitely regret. Although Hibiacus has raised their prices slightly, it still would have been cheaper than this bowl from Urban Herbivore.

The staff at Urban Herbivore just added insult to injury. Both workers behind the counter were surley and did not look happy to be there at all. They minimally engaged with customers and simply barker ""1.... 2.... 3...."" Etc as customers added each topping to their bowls.

I found the running shoes that I wear marked down to $80 when the usually sell for around $140-$160. Deal! I was sold!

I also decided to try on a few other styles and the sales lady was extremely helpful - she answered all of my questions and was very patient with getting me different sizes of the various shoes.

If I was writing this review based on the price marked for my shoes and the service I received in store, it would be five stars for sure! This changes when I got home...

When I got home I looked at my bill and saw that I was charged $90. I called the store back and spoke to the manager and explained the situation. He asked me if I had worn the shoes yet, and I had not. As such, he said I could return the shoes for a refund (sale products are normally final sale). He said that the box had been mislabelled and that the true price is the price that comes up when the box is scanned and this is the price that is set by head office. The manager said that since it was the price set by head office, there was nothing he could do about it. 

I was really unimpressed by this inflexibility. The manager was very pleasant to speak with, but it's my understanding that even if a product is mislabelled, the customer has the right to the marked price."	2	0	0	['saw', 'run', 'room', 'start', 'sidewalk', 'sale', 'yesterday', 'decid', 'perus', 'option', 'see', 'could', 'find', 'good', 'deal', 'found', 'run', 'shoe', 'wear', 'mark', 'usual', 'sell', 'around', 'deal', 'soldi', 'also', 'decid', 'tri', 'style', 'sale', 'ladi', 'extrem', 'help', 'answer', 'question', 'patient', 'get', 'differ', 'size', 'variou', 'shoesif', 'write', 'review', 'base', 'price', 'mark', 'shoe', 'servic', 'receiv', 'store', 'would', 'five', 'star', 'sure', 'chang', 'got', 'homewhen', 'got', 'home', 'look', 'bill', 'saw', 'charg', 'call', 'store', 'back', 'spoke', 'manag', 'explain', 'situat', 'ask', 'worn', 'shoe', 'yet', 'said', 'could', 'return', 'shoe', 'refund', 'sale', 'product', 'normal', 'final', 'sale', 'said', 'box', 'mislabel', 'true', 'price', 'price', 'come', 'box', 'scan', 'price', 'set', 'head', 'offic', 'manag', 'said', 'sinc', 'price', 'set', 'head', 'offic', 'noth', 'could', 'realli', 'unimpress', 'inflex', 'manag', 'pleasant', 'speak', 'understand', 'even', 'product', 'mislabel', 'custom', 'right', 'mark', 'price']

There was a group of about 10 of us, and we had tried to get in a few weeks earlier around 10:15 at night and the line was ridiculous! As we were keen to go to Rock n Horses, we decided to make a reservation for dinner for my friend's celebration. The reservation was for 6:30, and we were told that we would need to finish our meals by 9 because they would need to move our table off of the dance floor since we were a big group. Rock n Horses certainly isn't busy early on in the night, but there are some definite advantages to arriving early:

1) Free coat check (I believe before 9)
2) No cover
3) Guaranteed entry - no need to wait in slow moving lines!
4) $15 bottles of wine on Fridays between 5 and 7 (warning: this is not good quality wine!)

The food is pretty good and presented well for a bar. However we were a bit disappointed to hear that they were already out of corn on the cob when we placed our orders at 7. 

I had the garlic prawns ($12 - white wine, chilli garlic butter, grilled bread) without the butter. I also made a last minute adjustment to my meal and asked to have a side salad instead of the grilled bread. The waitress was great and rushed to see if they could accommodate my request. Although this dish is listed as a starter, it could easily be a main as it comes with plenty of shrimp! The shrimp arrive in a small cast iron skillet on top of a wooden board and the salad came in a bowl to the side. The shrimp were well cooked and very flavourful, and the salad really exceeded my expectations! There were fresh mixed greens along with large pieces of fresh carrots, blanched green beans, cucumbers, and other quality vegetable toppings.

Our server was great and easily managed our group and our complicated orders. The establishment also allowed us to bring in our own cupcakes for our friend's birthday; however, given the theme of the venue I was expecting a bit more in terms of 'presentation' when we asked for the cupcakes - a song or something would have been nice! One hiccough with the service was that we did not receive separate bills. Our server was able to ring us through on separate credit cards though.

The rest of the evening was pretty fun with a number of group members getting up for a ride on the mechanical bull! The music was your typical country tunes, with staff members providing line dancing 'lessons' early on in the evening.

The restaurant was not particularly busy and we were seated near the front so I did not have a chance to see the rest of the restaurant or the patio which other yelpers have mentioned.

I had the kale, roasted tomato, and green lentil salad ($9.95) and asked for it without pistachios. The roasted tomatoes were unique and quite tasty, but I only received 4 slices of tomatoes, and given that it is in the title of the salad, I was expecting a bit more. The service was standard, although we did have to actively ask for refills on water \/ tea a few times.

My iPhone 5 stopped working about 3 weeks ago. It wouldn't turn on and when I connected it to a power source, it just alternated between a black screen with a white apple and a black screen with a white outline of a battery with a bit of red inside. I brought it here the next day, and there was already a line formed outside the store waiting for it to open when I arrived around 11:50am. Once I was served, he knew exactly what was wrong. My battery was fried and he opened up my phone and showed me my visibly damaged battery. He replaced it with a new one  for about $50+tax and everything was working perfectly for about two weeks (one week ago from this review). Up until this point I was definitely giving a 5 star rating! 

Then my phone randomly turned off on itself. I turned it back on and then a few minutes later it was off again. I turned it back on, and it seemed fine, so I just left it. Then a few days later it happened again, but this time it continuously was turning itself right back off again. It reached about 70% power and it just completely turned off and would not restart. I plugged it in and then it seemed to be fine (I should note - I was inside, and had been inside for quite some time - this becomes a bit more important later). The next day I decided to bring it back to the store to have it examined. On my walk to the store (I walked from Yonge and College to Yonge and Wellesley), it turned off, then back on again, then completely off. I was told that iPhones have a tendency to turn off in the cold weather... hmmm.. this never happened once to me in the previous 3 years that I've had this phone.. and it's been outside in temperatures much colder than the balmy 3 degree weather that day! I was a bit skeptical about being given this as an explanation. Then I was told that sometimes when they put in new batteries, you have to backup your phone and restore it to factory settings for your phone to properly recognize the new battery. Fair enough, but I wish I had been told this on my initial visit. Regardless he replaced the battery again free of charge."	2	0	0	['init', 'go', 'give', 'star', 'review', 'experi', 'explain', 'deduct', 'star', 'iphon', 'stop', 'work', 'week', 'ago', 'wouldnt', 'turn', 'connect', 'power', 'sourc', 'altern', 'black', 'screen', 'white', 'appl', 'black', 'screen', 'white', 'outlin', 'batteri', 'bit', 'red', 'insid', 'brought', 'next', 'day', 'alreadi', 'line', 'form', 'outsid', 'store', 'wait', 'open', 'arriv', 'around', 'serv', 'knew', 'exactli', 'wrong', 'batteri', 'fri', 'open', 'phone', 'show', 'visibl', 'damag', 'batteri', 'replac', 'new', 'one', 'tax', 'everyth', 'work', 'perfectli', 'two', 'week', 'one', 'week', 'ago', 'review', 'point', 'definit', 'give', 'star', 'rate', 'phone', 'randomli', 'turn', 'turn', 'back', 'minut', 'later', 'turn', 'back', 'seem', 'fine', 'left', 'day', 'later', 'happen', 'time', 'continu', 'turn', 'right', 'back', 'reach', 'power', 'complet', 'turn', 'would', 'restart', 'plug', 'seem', 'fine', 'note', 'insid', 'insid', 'quit', 'time', 'becom', 'bit', 'import', 'later', 'next', 'day', 'decid', 'bring', 'back', 'store', 'examin', 'walk', 'store', 'walk', 'yong', 'colleg', 'yong', 'wellesley', 'turn', 'back', 'complet', 'told', 'iphon', 'tendenc', 'turn', 'cold', 'weather', 'hmmm', 'never', 'happen', 'previou', 'year', 'ive', 'phone', 'outsid', 'temperatur', 'much', 'colder', 'balmi', 'degre', 'weather', 'day', 'bit', 'skeptic', 'given', 'explan', 'told', 'sometim', 'put', 'new', 'batteri', 'backup', 'phone', 'restor', 'factori', 'set', 'phone', 'properli', 'recogn', 'new', 'batteri', 'fair', 'enough', 'wish', 'told', 'initi', 'visit', 'regardless', 'replac', 'batteri', 'free', 'charg']

I came here for dinner with some friends to try out an Asian restaurant in the area that none of us had ever been to before. We were welcomed and immediately brought complimentary green tea. I love it when restaurants do this without you having to ask for it. I also like that all of the tables had low-sodium soy sauce so you didn't have to ask for it. The restaurant is clean; however, the menus are looking a bit worn out. I 

I ordered three smaller dishes:
1) Mango Salad ($5) - mango, green \/ red peppers, and white \/ red onion slices - this was fine, although a fair amount of the mango was not ripe enough so was a bit tough to eat. 
2) Asparagus roll ($3.50) - basic 6 pieces of asparagus maki. I liked how the asparagus was steamed and not tempura. 
3) BBQ Squid ($6) - this was my most disappointing dish of the night. I love good grilled squid, so this is a critical dish for me! For starters, it arrived quite a bit longer after my other dishes and my friends' dishes - to the point that I had to ask the waitress if it was coming because I wasn't sure if they had forgotten about it or not. Once it arrived it was way too overcooked. It was charred in many places and a lot of pieces were extremely tough, making it inedible. 

I may return to Ginza in the future, although I would try different dishes. I wouldn't rush back here as there are many other Asian restaurants in the neighbourhood where I have had better food at a similar price point."	2	0	0	['realli', 'want', 'like', 'ginza', 'unfortun', 'bit', 'disappointedi', 'came', 'dinner', 'friend', 'tri', 'asian', 'restaur', 'area', 'none', 'us', 'ever', 'welcom', 'immedi', 'brought', 'complimentari', 'green', 'tea', 'love', 'restaur', 'without', 'ask', 'also', 'like', 'tabl', 'lowsodium', 'soy', 'sauc', 'didnt', 'ask', 'restaur', 'clean', 'howev', 'menu', 'look', 'bit', 'worn', 'order', 'three', 'smaller', 'dish', 'mango', 'salad', 'mango', 'green', 'red', 'pepper', 'white', 'red', 'onion', 'slice', 'fine', 'although', 'fair', 'amount', 'mango', 'ripe', 'enough', 'bit', 'tough', 'eat', 'asparagu', 'roll', 'basic', 'piec', 'asparagu', 'maki', 'like', 'asparagu', 'steam', 'tempura', 'bbq', 'squid', 'disappoint', 'dish', 'night', 'love', 'good', 'grill', 'squid', 'critic', 'dish', 'starter', 'arriv', 'quit', 'bit', 'longer', 'dish', 'friend', 'dish', 'point', 'ask', 'waitress', 'come', 'wasnt', 'sure', 'forgotten', 'arriv', 'way', 'overcook', 'char', 'mani', 'place', 'lot', 'piec', 'extrem', 'tough', 'make', 'ined', 'may', 'return', 'ginza', 'futur', 'although', 'would', 'tri', 'differ', 'dish', 'wouldnt', 'rush', 'back', 'mani', 'asian', 'restaur', 'neighbourhood', 'better', 'food', 'similar', 'price', 'point']

I have been going here for about three years now, and it is my go-to for Greek food. I have dined in, have ordered take out, and have ordered delivery without any issues and without compromising on food quality. It trumps the Greek restaurants on the Danforth where I find the food can often be too salty and oily.

The food is delicious and the customer service is great. My favourite dish is the village salad (big fresh chunks of peppers, cucumbers, onions, feta, and olives) topped with either grilled chicken, grilled calamari, or grilled shrimp. The grilled calamari is one of the best I have had, but you really can't go wrong with any of the three! The chicken souvlaki is also great. Even the small size is quite large, so if you order the regular size, be prepared to bring home leftovers! My friend ordered the Greek chicken wrap for take-out and it was massive - like two meals in one! I also really enjoy the complimentary grilled pita they give you as an appetizer topped with olive oil and garlic (they also provide this with all take out and delivery orders). It is especially yummy dipped in their hummus.

In addition to the quality of the food, the prices are fantastic! Especially given that within a five minute walk from the restaurant you will pay twice the price for half of the food. The owners and servers are very kind and more than willing to accommodate you and your dietary preferences (I don't like the olives or feta with my village salad). It is definitely a family-friendly restaurant and I am always impressed that they remember my favourite orders.

One aspect that I really liked (and appreciated) was the cheap drink menu! They have drink specials for each day of the week (Friday was a Long Island iced tea for $6.99). They also offer $2 shooters! Pretty hard to resist if you're looking to have a good time!

As I shop there frequently, I appreciate that the staff recognize me and will often come over to the self-serve check-out to enter my student discount without being asked.

I came in the early afternoon to purchase some fruit and vegetable party trays that I was going to bring to a meeting later on that evening. I was going to be passing the Sobeys again on my way from home to the meeting, but I didn't really want to carry the trays back and forth. I asked the manager if they would put the trays aside for me to pick up later, and she readily agreed to keep them in a downstairs fridge for me.

In the past I have often ordered the mixed house greens salad (tomato, cucumber, red onion and shredded carrots, tossed in our famous balsamic dressing, $10) and have asked for it to be topped with grilled shrimp (it's not an explicit option listed on the menu, but you can ask for it, $5). It's typically a pretty good dish that I enjoy. This time I had a number of issues with my experience at Brownstone Bistro

1) There were ice chunks in my shredded carrot! (I think there's enough said with that)
2) $5 for 3 measly pieces of shrimp seems quite excessive, especially when the shrimp were not very good. I don't know how they were cooked, but it tasted as though they were soaked in butter or oil. They were not very good.
3) Out of green tea - how does a restaurant run out of green tea for brunch?!
4) My dish did not come with fruit but my friends' did. I noticed that they received much less fruit than they had on previous visits.
5) Our server was rather slow and inattentive especially towards the end. We ended up sitting around waiting for our bills for quite some time. It wasn't too bad because we were having a good conversation, but It would have been nice had she checked in on us sooner.

The restaurant is a good and clean establishment that is decorated well and definitely a good option for a restaurant that is located in a mall when you want a sit down restaurant and don't feel like eating at a chain that is typical of shopping malls.

I ordered two appetizer dishes for my meal:
1) Misticanza - mixed lettuces, celery hearts, radish, aged sherry vinaigrette ($8) - this was a good salad and a decent sized portion for an appetizer
2) Frutti di Mare - marinated shrimp, scallops, calamari, red onion, crostini ($11.50) - this was like a ceviche (although with cooked seafood) or a seafood salad with a vinaigrette-type dressing served in a dish with two small and rather thin pieces of crostini on the side. If you order this dish, I would recommend that you get a salad too because you receive much more seafood than could possibly fit on the two pieces of crostini, so I ended up using the left over seafood as a topping on my salad.

I was the first to arrive and asked to be seated on the back patio as it was one if Toronto's beautiful summer nights and I had heard great things about the patio. Our waitress was extremely attentive and good-natured. I had a number of questions about the menu and she was able to answer all of them with ease and provided a number of good recommendations. I was initially seated at one of the tables at the back of the patio, but was hoping to sit at a booth. One of the booths became available while I was waiting for my friends to arrive, and our server was more than willing to allow me to change tables.

The dishes are fairly small here so we ordered a number - some we shared and some we had to ourselves.

For myself I ordered:
Ontario Spring Salad - this had good fresh vegetables, but I found the dressing to be really oily and I didn't like how salt and pepper were already on the salad when it was served as I found the salad to be quite salty.

Ol' shrimp bucket - this was a really yummy dish! I was surprised by the number of shrimp I received (maybe 11-12 large pieces) as I believe this dish was cheaper than the peel-your-own shrimp from the bar yet had more shrimp! I would have to caution though to be prepared for your hands to get messy because you have to peel your own shrimp, and the shrimp are marinated in a delicious seasoning. I would definitely recommend this dish.

Dishes we shared \/ ordered by my friends:

Scallops - 3 big scallops served with a pea purée. The scallops were cooked perfectly, my only complaint is that I wish it came with more! Another winning dish!

Fish and chips - my friend ordered this and thought the fish was cooked well and not too greasy. She also raved about the fries.

Grilled corn -  two large, seasoned cobs of corn. Another item loved by my friends.

Lobster taco - this was probably the most disappointing dish of the night. While it was still good, my friend thought it was a bit of a let down compared to other dishes we had that evening.

Overall we had a great night and I can't wait to return!"	0	0	0	['came', 'dinner', 'two', 'friend', 'rock', 'lobster', 'second', 'third', 'night', 'open', 'locat', 'first', 'arriv', 'ask', 'seat', 'back', 'patio', 'one', 'toronto', 'beauti', 'summer', 'night', 'heard', 'great', 'thing', 'patio', 'waitress', 'extrem', 'attent', 'goodnatur', 'number', 'question', 'menu', 'abl', 'answer', 'eas', 'provid', 'number', 'good', 'recommend', 'initi', 'seat', 'one', 'tabl', 'back', 'patio', 'hope', 'sit', 'booth', 'one', 'booth', 'becam', 'avail', 'wait', 'friend', 'arriv', 'server', 'will', 'allow', 'chang', 'tablesth', 'dish', 'fairli', 'small', 'order', 'number', 'share', 'ourselvesfor', 'orderedontario', 'spring', 'salad', 'good', 'fresh', 'veget', 'found', 'dress', 'realli', 'oili', 'didnt', 'like', 'salt', 'pepper', 'alreadi', 'salad', 'serv', 'found', 'salad', 'quit', 'saltyol', 'shrimp', 'bucket', 'realli', 'yummi', 'dish', 'surpris', 'number', 'shrimp', 'receiv', 'mayb', 'larg', 'piec', 'believ', 'dish', 'cheaper', 'peelyourown', 'shrimp', 'bar', 'yet', 'shrimp', 'would', 'caution', 'though', 'prepar', 'hand', 'get', 'messi', 'peel', 'shrimp', 'shrimp', 'marin', 'delici', 'season', 'would', 'definit', 'recommend', 'dishdish', 'share', 'order', 'friendsscallop', 'big', 'scallop', 'serv', 'pea', 'pure', 'scallop', 'cook', 'perfectli', 'complaint', 'wish', 'came', 'anoth', 'win', 'dishfish', 'chip', 'friend', 'order', 'thought', 'fish', 'cook', 'well', 'greasi', 'also', 'rave', 'friesgril', 'corn', 'two', 'larg', 'season', 'cob', 'corn', 'anoth', 'item', 'love', 'friendslobst', 'taco', 'probabl', 'disappoint', 'dish', 'night', 'still', 'good', 'friend', 'thought', 'bit', 'let', 'compar', 'dish', 'eveningoveral', 'great', 'night', 'cant', 'wait', 'return']

The environment is relaxed, unpretentious, and perfect for either after-work drinks with co-workers or grabbing drinks with friends before going to the downtown clubs. The drinks were cheap - on Friday nights, pints are $5 (or $5.50) before 10pm and my glass of wine was under $6 including tax. Overall: good service, good vibe, and I will definitely return.	0	0	0	['came', 'friday', 'night', 'go', 'downtown', 'bar', 'environ', 'relax', 'unpretenti', 'perfect', 'either', 'afterwork', 'drink', 'cowork', 'grab', 'drink', 'friend', 'go', 'downtown', 'club', 'drink', 'cheap', 'friday', 'night', 'pint', 'pm', 'glass', 'wine', 'includ', 'tax', 'overal', 'good', 'servic', 'good', 'vibe', 'definit', 'return']

It's a very friendly restaurant with a real family feel. It is casual, yet nice enough if you want a celebratory dinner. Due to the family-friendly feel, children are more than welcome here, although you won't see them running around or disrupting things. 

The wait staff are wonderful here. Everyone, including the owners are so warm and welcoming, and if you want to come on a Friday or Saturday night, you had better call ahead for a table because it is not uncommon to see a group of people standing at the door trying to come in and then have to be turned away because they are all booked up! If you are a regular, the wait staff truly makes an effort to get to know you. They know exactly what every member of my family will order every time we come - they might as well start preparing the dishes the second we walk in the door!

The menu is not huge, but they have pretty much everything you would expect at an Italian restaurant. If they don't have exactly what you are looking for, don't be afraid to ask. They are very accommodating and open to making substitutions. For example, I don't like mushrooms and they will gladly replace the mushrooms in the pasta primavera with asparagus or another vegetable. One time I was feeling like having some calamari in my pasta, and although this is not found on the menu, they happily made this for me. Although they do not have a specific children's menu, they will definitely custom make dishes to order for the little ones!

All in all, a wonderful and welcoming Italian restaurant that serves amazing food and does not feel pretentious. Take a visit there - it will be well worth it!"	8	0	1	['positano', 'stapl', 'famili', 'famili', 'member', 'go', 'least', 'week', 'friendli', 'restaur', 'real', 'famili', 'feel', 'casual', 'yet', 'nice', 'enough', 'want', 'celebratori', 'dinner', 'due', 'familyfriendli', 'feel', 'children', 'welcom', 'although', 'wont', 'see', 'run', 'around', 'disrupt', 'thing', 'wait', 'staff', 'wonder', 'everyon', 'includ', 'owner', 'warm', 'welcom', 'want', 'come', 'friday', 'saturday', 'night', 'better', 'call', 'ahead', 'tabl', 'uncommon', 'see', 'group', 'peopl', 'stand', 'door', 'tri', 'come', 'turn', 'away', 'book', 'regular', 'wait', 'staff', 'truli', 'make', 'effort', 'get', 'know', 'know', 'exactli', 'everi', 'member', 'famili', 'order', 'everi', 'time', 'come', 'might', 'well', 'start', 'prepar', 'dish', 'second', 'walk', 'doorth', 'menu', 'huge', 'pretti', 'much', 'everyth', 'would', 'expect', 'italian', 'restaur', 'dont', 'exactli', 'look', 'dont', 'afraid', 'ask', 'accommod', 'open', 'make', 'substitut', 'exampl', 'dont', 'like', 'mushroom', 'gladli', 'replac', 'mushroom', 'pasta', 'primavera', 'asparagu', 'anoth', 'veget', 'one', 'time', 'feel', 'like', 'calamari', 'pasta', 'although', 'found', 'menu', 'happili', 'made', 'although', 'specif', 'children', 'menu', 'definit', 'custom', 'make', 'dish', 'order', 'littl', 'onesal', 'wonder', 'welcom', 'italian', 'restaur', 'serv', 'amaz', 'food', 'feel', 'pretenti', 'take', 'visit', 'well', 'worth']

The restaurant is quite quaint with quirky decor - mismatched side plates, bright and vibrant paintings, etc.

We were greeted warmly, and although we had a reservation, it was not at all necessary as there were only about two other tables occupied, so we were told we could sit wherever we wanted. The server was very sweet and when she heard that it was our first time there, she was eager to tell us all about the concept of the place and the various events that are held there. 

I had items 1 and 2 as my main. Items 3 and 4 come with a small serving of the butternut squash soup and a very small tasting of each of the three salads in the 3-kind salad.

1) 3-Kind Salad ($9 - baby arugula w\/micro-sprouts, mixed bean, & roasted Ontario beets - vegan and gluten-free)
This was a good dish. The beets could have been roasted slightly longer to become more tender and they could have been seasoned a bit better. 

2) Curried Butternut Squash Soup ($7)
I was really looking forward to this dish as I had read some rave reviews on Yelp. It was a cold day so I was hoping for the soup to be pipping hot. It was definitely warm, but I would have liked it to be that temperature where you just have to give a gentle blow on the spoon before you have your first few sips. You could definitely taste the curry and the soup had a bit of a kick. There was definitely something added to the soup, and I'm not sure what it was (maybe potato?) that muted the flavour of the butternut squash, and I did not like this aspect of the dish. I did not like the bread that was served with the soup. It was more like crostini and it was rather crunchy. I would have preferred soft and fluffy bread that I could have dipped in my soup.

3) Vegetable Keema Curry ($13 - Stewed celery, mushroom, chickpea, onion, carrot, sweet bell pepper - vegan and gluten-free)
This dish was served with brown rice and there were generous portions of both the rice and the curry. I had a taste of my friend's dish and you could definitely appreciate the flavours. There was a strong hint of cinnamon, so if you are averse to cinnamon, I would avoid this dish.

4) Open-Faced Grilled Chicken Breast Sandwich ($16) 
This was a chicken breast that was sliced (and appeared to be sprinkled with cinnamon, among other seasonings) served alongside 3 large pieces of bread. The pickled vegetables that the menu's describes consisted of about four small spears of vegetables. There was also a balsamic glaze on the plate as well as three small side dishes of spreads for your sandwich (butter, grainy Dijon, and a red sauce that looked to be spicy). 

The prices were a bit steep for a lunch, but you get a decent amount of food, so it's not bad. However; for a similar soup and salad combo, I would go to the nearby Hibiscus on Augusta Ave for, in my opinion, a much better squash soup and more flavourful salad bowl for about half the price of the soup and salad here.

Our waitress came by after we paid and asked if we wanted some complimentary freshly squeezed juice. She offered us orange, apple, cranberry, or strawberry-basil. We decided to try the strawberry-basil and the cranberry. The strawberry-basil was quite nice and refreshing, and it was the juice we all preferred. The cranberry was fine, but it does not taste like typical cranberry juice. It smelled a bit odd and was not tart or sour like I was expecting when you eat fresh cranberries. Upon asking the waitress about this further, she explained that they do not actually make the juices there, but rather purchase them from another company, and that sweetener was added to the cranberry juice.

I would likely return to this restaurant again, although I will probably stick with Hibiscus as my go-to for a soup and salad combo in the area."	2	0	2	['came', 'lunch', 'two', 'friend', 'one', 'vegan', 'cannot', 'gluten', 'rest', 'us', 'select', 'windup', 'bird', 'cafe', 'abl', 'cater', 'dietari', 'need', 'restaur', 'quit', 'quaint', 'quirki', 'decor', 'mismatch', 'side', 'plate', 'bright', 'vibrant', 'paint', 'etcw', 'greet', 'warmli', 'although', 'reserv', 'necessari', 'two', 'tabl', 'occupi', 'told', 'could', 'sit', 'wherev', 'want', 'server', 'sweet', 'heard', 'first', 'time', 'eager', 'tell', 'us', 'concept', 'place', 'variou', 'event', 'held', 'item', 'main', 'item', 'come', 'small', 'serv', 'butternut', 'squash', 'soup', 'small', 'tast', 'three', 'salad', 'kind', 'salad', 'kind', 'salad', 'babi', 'arugula', 'wmicrosprout', 'mix', 'bean', 'roast', 'ontario', 'beet', 'vegan', 'glutenfreethi', 'good', 'dish', 'beet', 'could', 'roast', 'slightli', 'longer', 'becom', 'tender', 'could', 'season', 'bit', 'better', 'curri', 'butternut', 'squash', 'soup', 'realli', 'look', 'forward', 'dish', 'read', 'rave', 'review', 'yelp', 'cold', 'day', 'hope', 'soup', 'pip', 'hot', 'definit', 'warm', 'would', 'like', 'temperatur', 'give', 'gentl', 'blow', 'spoon', 'first', 'sip', 'could', 'definit', 'tast', 'curri', 'soup', 'bit', 'kick', 'definit', 'someth', 'ad', 'soup', 'im', 'sure', 'mayb', 'potato', 'mute', 'flavour', 'butternut', 'squash', 'like', 'aspect', 'dish', 'like', 'bread', 'serv', 'soup', 'like', 'crostini', 'rather', 'crunchi', 'would', 'prefer', 'soft', 'fluffi', 'bread', 'could', 'dip', 'soup', 'veget', 'keema', 'curri', 'stew', 'celeri', 'mushroom', 'chickpea', 'onion', 'carrot', 'sweet', 'bell', 'pepper', 'vegan', 'glutenfreethi', 'dish', 'serv', 'brown', 'rice', 'gener', 'portion', 'rice', 'curri', 'tast', 'friend', 'dish', 'could', 'definit', 'appreci', 'flavour', 'strong', 'hint', 'cinnamon', 'avers', 'cinnamon', 'would', 'avoid', 'dish', 'openfac', 'grill', 'chicken', 'breast', 'sandwich', 'chicken', 'breast', 'slice', 'appear', 'sprinkl', 'cinnamon', 'among', 'season', 'serv', 'alongsid', 'larg', 'piec', 'bread', 'pickl', 'veget', 'menu', 'describ', 'consist', 'four', 'small', 'spear', 'veget', 'also', 'balsam', 'glaze', 'plate', 'well', 'three', 'small', 'side', 'dish', 'spread', 'sandwich', 'butter', 'graini', 'dijon', 'red', 'sauc', 'look', 'spici', 'price', 'bit', 'steep', 'lunch', 'get', 'decent', 'amount', 'food', 'bad', 'howev', 'similar', 'soup', 'salad', 'combo', 'would', 'go', 'nearbi', 'hibiscu', 'augusta', 'ave', 'opinion', 'much', 'better', 'squash', 'soup', 'flavour', 'salad', 'bowl', 'half', 'price', 'soup', 'salad', 'hereour', 'waitress', 'came', 'paid', 'ask', 'want', 'complimentari', 'freshli', 'squeez', 'juic', 'offer', 'us', 'orang', 'appl', 'cranberri', 'strawberrybasil', 'decid', 'tri', 'strawberrybasil', 'cranberri', 'strawberrybasil', 'quit', 'nice', 'refresh', 'juic', 'prefer', 'cranberri', 'fine', 'tast', 'like', 'typic', 'cranberri', 'juic', 'smell', 'bit', 'odd', 'tart', 'sour', 'like', 'expect', 'eat', 'fresh', 'cranberri', 'upon', 'ask', 'waitress', 'explain', 'actual', 'make', 'juic', 'rather', 'purchas', 'anoth', 'compani', 'sweeten', 'ad', 'cranberri', 'juicei', 'would', 'like', 'return', 'restaur', 'although', 'probabl', 'stick', 'hibiscu', 'goto', 'soup', 'salad', 'combo', 'area']

The entrance to the restaurant can best be described as unassuming. It would be easy to miss it.

Two of us arrived for dinner around 5:30 on a Sunday evening without a reservation. We were told the only seats available were at the bar, so we sat there.

The food was good, I will give it that. But there are very few vegetarian dishes, and they were not very accommodating. Here is what we ordered:

Scallop and crema - this is not at all what I was expecting. It was more like a scallop ceviche. It was a cold dish of chopped up scallop on top of crema. I asked if we could have it with the crema on the side and was immediately shot down. I really dislike when restaurants do this and do not accommodate for even slight adjustments to their menu. When the dish arrived, the scallop had literally been scooped on top of the crema, so it could easily have been prepared with the crema on the side.

Green tomatoes - this dish had dollops of chicken liver with tiny slices of fried green tomatoes on top, and then a bed of mixed greens placed on top of all of that. There was a good kick to the chicken liver, but I wouldn't order this dish again.

Shrimp and greens - about 5 pieces of grilled shrimp (cooked well) on top of a lot of buttery-oily sauce, with oily sautéed spinach on top. The shrimp were really yummy, but I found the spinach to be quite flavourless.

Mackerel - long thin piece of grilled mackerel on top of a salsa verde that was strongly flavoured with cilantro. I would avoid this dish if you don't like cilantro!!

The music was good here - a mix of Motown and indie stuff. Tip: they don't take American Express."	0	0	0	['entranc', 'restaur', 'best', 'describ', 'unassum', 'would', 'easi', 'miss', 'ittwo', 'us', 'arriv', 'dinner', 'around', 'sunday', 'even', 'without', 'reserv', 'told', 'seat', 'avail', 'bar', 'sat', 'thereth', 'food', 'good', 'give', 'vegetarian', 'dish', 'accommod', 'orderedscallop', 'crema', 'expect', 'like', 'scallop', 'cevich', 'cold', 'dish', 'chop', 'scallop', 'top', 'crema', 'ask', 'could', 'crema', 'side', 'immedi', 'shot', 'realli', 'dislik', 'restaur', 'accommod', 'even', 'slight', 'adjust', 'menu', 'dish', 'arriv', 'scallop', 'liter', 'scoop', 'top', 'crema', 'could', 'easili', 'prepar', 'crema', 'sidegreen', 'tomato', 'dish', 'dollop', 'chicken', 'liver', 'tini', 'slice', 'fri', 'green', 'tomato', 'top', 'bed', 'mix', 'green', 'place', 'top', 'good', 'kick', 'chicken', 'liver', 'wouldnt', 'order', 'dish', 'againshrimp', 'green', 'piec', 'grill', 'shrimp', 'cook', 'well', 'top', 'lot', 'butteryoili', 'sauc', 'oili', 'saut', 'spinach', 'top', 'shrimp', 'realli', 'yummi', 'found', 'spinach', 'quit', 'flavourlessmackerel', 'long', 'thin', 'piec', 'grill', 'mackerel', 'top', 'salsa', 'verd', 'strongli', 'flavour', 'cilantro', 'would', 'avoid', 'dish', 'dont', 'like', 'cilantroth', 'music', 'good', 'mix', 'motown', 'indi', 'stuff', 'tip', 'dont', 'take', 'american', 'express']

The ambiance and environment is really cool here. It's too bad that the restaurant doesn't have a patio as I'm sure the decor could have been really well done on one. I had the sense that the design was aiming for a rustic, run-down, side-of-the-road Mexican establishment, but with a hip and edgy vibe, and I would say they certain accomplished that feeling. As other reviews have mentioned, there are no paper menus. Their offerings are simply listed on chalkboards on the walls. I did not have an issues with reading the boards as I was sitting right in front of one and the restaurant was not too busy, but I could see how it would be a pain if you are ordering multiple rounds of food or drinks (which is how they recommend ordering) to have to constantly remember what each dish contains. The washrooms are clean, but I only saw a single room for ladies and a single room for men, so I imagine that there can be a line up at times, especially later in the night.

Dishes we ordered:

1) Guacamole and chips - my friends were disappointed that it did not come in a mortar bowl (how it is served at Playa Cabana) because it gave the sense that it was not quite as fresh. Apparently the guac does have a slight kick to it.

2) Fried quaso chihuahua - my friend likes this, but it was also a bit spicy. It is literally a block of fried cheese on a tortilla

3) Kalbi beef taco - we were told that this would be little pieces of charred beef cooked medium-rare. We were all disappointed to see that the meat was definitely more cooked than medium-rare. It was more like medium-well.

4) Baja fish taco - I asked for this to be grilled, not fried, and to have it without the aioli. The waitress was happy to oblige. It was a good dish and I really like the slaw that is served on top, but I thought that the fish was slightly undercooked and I found that the tortilla had gotten a bit soggy (possibly from the fish?) which made it hard to eat. Despite this I was happy to see that they were not stingy on the amount of fish that they provide!

5) Grilled calamari with burnt arbol kimchi - the calamari was delicious, I would definitely recommend ordering it! I did not find that it came with a lot of kimchi, and do not order it thinking that it is like Korean kimchi, because it isn't.

7) Jumbo shrimp taco - this really was a jumbo shrimp which is tempuraed, placed on a tortilla, and loaded with a bunch of toppings. My friend said it was rather spicy, but she really liked it.

Service - I am a bit torn about what to write about this. I had the opposite experience to what other reviews have mentioned. Our server was extremely pleasant and very engaging. She took the time to go through every dish and offering with great detail when we told her that we had not been to the restaurant before. I have a friend who is both vegan and sensitive to gluten (she was not with me on this visit) and so I am always on the look out for places that can cater to both carnivores and people with dietary restrictions. I asked the server about one of their dishes (the portobello fajitas) because it sounded like it could cater to my friend's needs. The waitress said it would fit the bill and she also suggested other dishes that can be adapted to fit my friend's needs. This aspect of service gets five stars! I called earlier in the day to see if it would be possible to change our reservation from 5:30 to 6 because 5:30 is a bit early for dinner. I was told that this would not be possible because there were other groups coming in at 7, and that the restaurant tends to get busy around then. When we arrived at the restaurant at 5:30, we weren't too hungry so we thought we would just enjoy some drinks and guac with chips while we figured out what to eat. I got the sense that they wanted us to move along and order our food because they didn't want us to take up the table for too long. When we left at 7:20, I was surprised to see that the restaurant was only about 60-70% full. As a result, it was disappointing that we were felt a bit rushed earlier on in the meal. We also did not ask for our bill, it was simply placed on our table when we had finished our plates and we were not given the chance to ask for separate bills (although our sever was happy to enter individual amounts when we paid).

Overall I had a good time at Barrio Correano, but I do not feel any real urgency to rush back. I would go if other people wanted to try it out. It won't be a staple in my restaurant repertoire."	0	0	0	['would', 'give', 'barrio', 'correano', 'star', 'came', 'two', 'friend', 'dinner', 'friday', 'night', 'want', 'reserv', 'around', 'avail', 'ambianc', 'environ', 'realli', 'cool', 'bad', 'restaur', 'doesnt', 'patio', 'im', 'sure', 'decor', 'could', 'realli', 'well', 'done', 'one', 'sens', 'design', 'aim', 'rustic', 'rundown', 'sideoftheroad', 'mexican', 'establish', 'hip', 'edgi', 'vibe', 'would', 'say', 'certain', 'accomplish', 'feel', 'review', 'mention', 'paper', 'menu', 'offer', 'simpli', 'list', 'chalkboard', 'wall', 'issu', 'read', 'board', 'sit', 'right', 'front', 'one', 'restaur', 'busi', 'could', 'see', 'would', 'pain', 'order', 'multipl', 'round', 'food', 'drink', 'recommend', 'order', 'constantli', 'rememb', 'dish', 'contain', 'washroom', 'clean', 'saw', 'singl', 'room', 'ladi', 'singl', 'room', 'men', 'imagin', 'line', 'time', 'especi', 'later', 'nightdish', 'order', 'guacamol', 'chip', 'friend', 'disappoint', 'come', 'mortar', 'bowl', 'serv', 'playa', 'cabana', 'gave', 'sens', 'quit', 'fresh', 'appar', 'guac', 'slight', 'kick', 'fri', 'quaso', 'chihuahua', 'friend', 'like', 'also', 'bit', 'spici', 'liter', 'block', 'fri', 'chees', 'tortilla', 'kalbi', 'beef', 'taco', 'told', 'would', 'littl', 'piec', 'char', 'beef', 'cook', 'mediumrar', 'disappoint', 'see', 'meat', 'definit', 'cook', 'mediumrar', 'like', 'mediumwel', 'baja', 'fish', 'taco', 'ask', 'grill', 'fri', 'without', 'aioli', 'waitress', 'happi', 'oblig', 'good', 'dish', 'realli', 'like', 'slaw', 'serv', 'top', 'thought', 'fish', 'slightli', 'undercook', 'found', 'tortilla', 'gotten', 'bit', 'soggi', 'possibl', 'fish', 'made', 'hard', 'eat', 'despit', 'happi', 'see', 'stingi', 'amount', 'fish', 'provid', 'grill', 'calamari', 'burnt', 'arbol', 'kimchi', 'calamari', 'delici', 'would', 'definit', 'recommend', 'order', 'find', 'came', 'lot', 'kimchi', 'order', 'think', 'like', 'korean', 'kimchi', 'isnt', 'jumbo', 'shrimp', 'taco', 'realli', 'jumbo', 'shrimp', 'tempura', 'place', 'tortilla', 'load', 'bunch', 'top', 'friend', 'said', 'rather', 'spici', 'realli', 'like', 'itservic', 'bit', 'torn', 'write', 'opposit', 'experi', 'review', 'mention', 'server', 'extrem', 'pleasant', 'engag', 'took', 'time', 'go', 'everi', 'dish', 'offer', 'great', 'detail', 'told', 'restaur', 'friend', 'vegan', 'sensit', 'gluten', 'visit', 'alway', 'look', 'place', 'cater', 'carnivor', 'peopl', 'dietari', 'restrict', 'ask', 'server', 'one', 'dish', 'portobello', 'fajita', 'sound', 'like', 'could', 'cater', 'friend', 'need', 'waitress', 'said', 'would', 'fit', 'bill', 'also', 'suggest', 'dish', 'adapt', 'fit', 'friend', 'need', 'aspect', 'servic', 'get', 'five', 'star', 'call', 'earlier', 'day', 'see', 'would', 'possibl', 'chang', 'reserv', 'bit', 'earli', 'dinner', 'told', 'would', 'possibl', 'group', 'come', 'restaur', 'tend', 'get', 'busi', 'around', 'arriv', 'restaur', 'werent', 'hungri', 'thought', 'would', 'enjoy', 'drink', 'guac', 'chip', 'figur', 'eat', 'got', 'sens', 'want', 'us', 'move', 'along', 'order', 'food', 'didnt', 'want', 'us', 'take', 'tabl', 'long', 'left', 'surpris', 'see', 'restaur', 'full', 'result', 'disappoint', 'felt', 'bit', 'rush', 'earlier', 'meal', 'also', 'ask', 'bill', 'simpli', 'place', 'tabl', 'finish', 'plate', 'given', 'chanc', 'ask', 'separ', 'bill', 'although', 'sever', 'happi', 'enter', 'individu', 'amount', 'paidoveral', 'good', 'time', 'barrio', 'correano', 'feel', 'real', 'urgenc', 'rush', 'back', 'would', 'go', 'peopl', 'want', 'tri', 'wont', 'stapl', 'restaur', 'repertoir']

My Favourite has been a neighbourhood staple for well over 15 years, and most summer nights you can see crowds of people outside the small store consuming their ice cream and a cluster if people inside waiting to be served. When I was younger, I would eagerly count down the days until My Favourite opened.

For the past few years now, I would say that I have been continuously less impressed. While their product offering had remained the same (Greg's ice cream, create-you-own frozen yoghurt with the choice of two flavours, and a random assortment of Popsicles and frozen treats), their prices have definitely gone up, to the point that it might be more worthwhile to take a walk on a lovely summer's day \/ night to one of the Yorkville establishments. However, I would recommend the mint chip ice cream without hesitation! It is not the sickly fake green colour that is commonly found in mint chocolate chip ice creams, and it has a refreshing minty taste with real tasting chocolate chips.

As previous reviewers have mentioned, service can be unpredictable. Sometimes you have a really nice server and sometimes it seems as if they couldn't care less whether or not you buy their product.

I also have to comment on the great name - My Favourite! I love it when it say to my friends, ""Let's go to 'My Favourite' for ice cream"", and they respond with a confused, ""Okay, what place is your favourite?"".,, no no, it's called My Favourite!"	1	1	2	['badli', 'want', 'give', 'favourit', 'four', 'star', 'thing', 'prevent', 'somi', 'favourit', 'neighbourhood', 'stapl', 'well', 'year', 'summer', 'night', 'see', 'crowd', 'peopl', 'outsid', 'small', 'store', 'consum', 'ice', 'cream', 'cluster', 'peopl', 'insid', 'wait', 'serv', 'younger', 'would', 'eagerli', 'count', 'day', 'favourit', 'openedfor', 'past', 'year', 'would', 'say', 'continu', 'less', 'impress', 'product', 'offer', 'remain', 'greg', 'ice', 'cream', 'createyouown', 'frozen', 'yoghurt', 'choic', 'two', 'flavour', 'random', 'assort', 'popsicl', 'frozen', 'treat', 'price', 'definit', 'gone', 'point', 'might', 'worthwhil', 'take', 'walk', 'love', 'summer', 'day', 'night', 'one', 'yorkvil', 'establish', 'howev', 'would', 'recommend', 'mint', 'chip', 'ice', 'cream', 'without', 'hesit', 'sickli', 'fake', 'green', 'colour', 'commonli', 'found', 'mint', 'chocol', 'chip', 'ice', 'cream', 'refresh', 'minti', 'tast', 'real', 'tast', 'chocol', 'chipsa', 'previou', 'review', 'mention', 'servic', 'unpredict', 'sometim', 'realli', 'nice', 'server', 'sometim', 'seem', 'couldnt', 'care', 'less', 'whether', 'buy', 'producti', 'also', 'comment', 'great', 'name', 'favourit', 'love', 'say', 'friend', 'let', 'go', 'favourit', 'ice', 'cream', 'respond', 'confus', 'okay', 'place', 'favourit', 'call', 'favourit']

Our server, Megan, was great at handling the size of the party and our various needs as we had a lot of questions and many specific requests for our various meals.

I ordered the grilled jerk calamari which was pretty good, although I did not taste the jerk seasoning. It came with arugula and pickled onions which were actually really tasty (and I don't usually like them.

Other diners in the group ordered a variety of dishes (e.g. Burgers, fish and chips, chicken panini, etc.) and everyone was quite pleased with their choices with the exception of one girl. She ordered the pesto chicken salad, and she didn't really like it. I gathered that the chicken was cold and the fish just wasn't what she was expecting.

The ambiance is pretty casual, although I understand that a dance floor opens up there later in the night, we just didn't stick around to see it. 

I'd go back for a meal, casual drinks, or to partake in the dance floor!"	0	0	0	['came', 'dinner', 'saturday', 'night', 'group', 'peopl', 'server', 'megan', 'great', 'handl', 'size', 'parti', 'variou', 'need', 'lot', 'question', 'mani', 'specif', 'request', 'variou', 'mealsi', 'order', 'grill', 'jerk', 'calamari', 'pretti', 'good', 'although', 'tast', 'jerk', 'season', 'came', 'arugula', 'pickl', 'onion', 'actual', 'realli', 'tasti', 'dont', 'usual', 'like', 'themoth', 'diner', 'group', 'order', 'varieti', 'dish', 'eg', 'burger', 'fish', 'chip', 'chicken', 'panini', 'etc', 'everyon', 'quit', 'pleas', 'choic', 'except', 'one', 'girl', 'order', 'pesto', 'chicken', 'salad', 'didnt', 'realli', 'like', 'gather', 'chicken', 'cold', 'fish', 'wasnt', 'expectingth', 'ambianc', 'pretti', 'casual', 'although', 'understand', 'danc', 'floor', 'open', 'later', 'night', 'didnt', 'stick', 'around', 'see', 'id', 'go', 'back', 'meal', 'casual', 'drink', 'partak', 'danc', 'floor']

I came here for lunch with a friend on Saturday as we were in the mood for sushi. The restaurant is very small but decorated well. We were welcomed immediately and brought to one of the few remaining tables. As soon as we sat down we were given complimentary green tea, salad, and miso soup. We had not even opened the menus yet! So far they were starting off very well.

I ordered the shrimp sashimi ($8 - four pieces) and the cucumber roll ($3 - eight pieces). After ordering, we enjoyed our appetizers and both commented on how much we like our salads. Although it was the standard iceberg lettuce that you tend to get at Japanese restaurants, the dressing was different and was really good! Neither of us had the miso soup as we just do not enjoy it in general. 

Our main dishes arrived quickly and we both commented on the size of the rolls - we were not expecting to receive eight pieces - and eight pieces that were stuffed well with a good rice to filling ratio! I like that they brought all four of our dishes at the same time (my friend's two rolls and my sashimi and cucumber roll); however, it was a bit odd that they split up our two orders and put one if each of our orders on two different plates. As in my shrimp was plated with one of my friend's rolls and my cucumber roll was plated with her other roll. My shrimp sashimi was very fresh and were good sized pieces. 

The service was also very good and the wait staff were pleasant. WOW Sushi loses half of a star because I thought that $8 for four pieces of shrimp sashimi was a bit steep. They do have lunch specials, so the prices may not be as bad if you order one of those.

All in all this was a good experience and I will return. I would recommend WOW Sushi if you are looking for a quiet place for lunch in Yorkville where you will get good quality food and not pay astronomical prices."	1	0	0	['realli', 'star', 'rate', 'came', 'lunch', 'friend', 'saturday', 'mood', 'sushi', 'restaur', 'small', 'decor', 'well', 'welcom', 'immedi', 'brought', 'one', 'remain', 'tabl', 'soon', 'sat', 'given', 'complimentari', 'green', 'tea', 'salad', 'miso', 'soup', 'even', 'open', 'menu', 'yet', 'far', 'start', 'welli', 'order', 'shrimp', 'sashimi', 'four', 'piec', 'cucumb', 'roll', 'eight', 'piec', 'order', 'enjoy', 'appet', 'comment', 'much', 'like', 'salad', 'although', 'standard', 'iceberg', 'lettuc', 'tend', 'get', 'japanes', 'restaur', 'dress', 'differ', 'realli', 'good', 'neither', 'us', 'miso', 'soup', 'enjoy', 'gener', 'main', 'dish', 'arriv', 'quickli', 'comment', 'size', 'roll', 'expect', 'receiv', 'eight', 'piec', 'eight', 'piec', 'stuf', 'well', 'good', 'rice', 'fill', 'ratio', 'like', 'brought', 'four', 'dish', 'time', 'friend', 'two', 'roll', 'sashimi', 'cucumb', 'roll', 'howev', 'bit', 'odd', 'split', 'two', 'order', 'put', 'one', 'order', 'two', 'differ', 'plate', 'shrimp', 'plate', 'one', 'friend', 'roll', 'cucumb', 'roll', 'plate', 'roll', 'shrimp', 'sashimi', 'fresh', 'good', 'size', 'piec', 'servic', 'also', 'good', 'wait', 'staff', 'pleasant', 'wow', 'sushi', 'lose', 'half', 'star', 'thought', 'four', 'piec', 'shrimp', 'sashimi', 'bit', 'steep', 'lunch', 'special', 'price', 'may', 'bad', 'order', 'one', 'thoseal', 'good', 'experi', 'return', 'would', 'recommend', 'wow', 'sushi', 'look', 'quiet', 'place', 'lunch', 'yorkvil', 'get', 'good', 'qualiti', 'food', 'pay', 'astronom', 'price']

The restaurant wasn't too busy when we arrived, but it filled up pretty quickly. It is a small establishment, so if you are keen to go then you may want a reservation. As other reviewers have mentioned, the restaurant becomes extremely noisy and it is very difficult to hear your companions speak. I am a young person and had to ask my friends to repeat themselves on numerous occasions. The decor is pretty basic although they do have interesting serving plates. I also liked how there is a very open kitchen (look to your left when you enter) so you can see everything the chefs are doing.

Service was satisfactory. There was a bus boy and it seemed like his only job was to clear plates and fill water glasses. Our glasses were never empty, but he always seemed to be at our table. This could be fixed if they used bigger water glasses!

There were a few things that irritated me about our service that made me feel like the waitress was trying to increase the size of our bill:

1) My friend and I wanted to share a glass of white wine and she clearly explained this to the waitress and asked her to bring a second empty glass. When our waitress came back, she returned with two rather full looking glasses of wine. When we asked if that was one glass that had been split in half, she said she had thought we ordered two glasses of wine.

2) When asked about dish recommendations, she always suggested the more expensive of two options. This happened twice to me, so it seemed a bit suspicious.

3) As other reviewers had mentioned, the waitress recommended a pound of fish per person if you go for ""the big catch"". But, there were no fish that were 1 pound, the smallest was 1.5 pounds. You also hVe to be careful because the prices of the fish are not indicated on the specials chalkboard and you have to ask for them. Prices ranged from about $50 to over $80.

The reason why this restaurant gets three stars rather than two is because of the food. Three of us ordered:

1) Gazpacho ($10) - this was the worst dish of the meal. It was a gazpacho soup with seafood garnish. (1 shrimp, 2 very small scallops, a hunk of white fish, and a few rings of calamari). The calamari was extremely chewy and I personally found it to be inedible. The flavour of the gazpacho base was decent and had a bit if a kick, but I found it to be rather salty and disgustingly oily such that I couldn't finish it. I would never order this dish again... and it came recommended from our waitress. 

2) Tuna Cesar salad ($11) - this was a decent portion and my friend liked it.

3) Clams linguine ($19) - another good sized portion and my friend finished it off, so I think he enjoyed it! It was a bit odd that they did not give him a spoon for the linguine or a side plate for his empty shells and he had to ask for both.

4) Sea diver scallops with a sweet pea purée and a bacon garnish ($29) - my friend loved this dish and said she would definitely order it again. I tried a bite of one of her scallops and would have to agree that they were quite well cooked.

5) Roasted halibut with a zucchini leek side ($30) - this came with two good sized fillets of halibut. The fish was cooked perfectly. The zucchini leek side consisted primarily of olives and capers, and I did not find much zucchini or leek. Might would order this again if I came back to the restaurant.

6) Sautéed kale and spinach with roasted garlic ($5) - my friend ordered this as a side to her scallops. I had a bite and I thought that the greens were fine, but rather flavourless. I wouldn't order this dish again, but would try a different side instead. 

The scallops and the halibut were what elevated the restaurant from two stars to three. There are many other interesting restaurants in the area, and new ones are constantly opening. I wouldn't go back to Catch just for the halibut and the scallops. Overall I was disappointed with my experience."	0	0	0	['came', 'catch', 'around', 'thursday', 'even', 'dinner', 'realli', 'excit', 'tri', 'catch', 'love', 'seafood', 'came', 'highli', 'recommend', 'friendth', 'restaur', 'wasnt', 'busi', 'arriv', 'fill', 'pretti', 'quickli', 'small', 'establish', 'keen', 'go', 'may', 'want', 'reserv', 'review', 'mention', 'restaur', 'becom', 'extrem', 'noisi', 'difficult', 'hear', 'companion', 'speak', 'young', 'person', 'ask', 'friend', 'repeat', 'numer', 'occas', 'decor', 'pretti', 'basic', 'although', 'interest', 'serv', 'plate', 'also', 'like', 'open', 'kitchen', 'look', 'left', 'enter', 'see', 'everyth', 'chef', 'doingservic', 'satisfactori', 'bu', 'boy', 'seem', 'like', 'job', 'clear', 'plate', 'fill', 'water', 'glass', 'glass', 'never', 'empti', 'alway', 'seem', 'tabl', 'could', 'fix', 'use', 'bigger', 'water', 'glassesther', 'thing', 'irrit', 'servic', 'made', 'feel', 'like', 'waitress', 'tri', 'increas', 'size', 'bill', 'friend', 'want', 'share', 'glass', 'white', 'wine', 'clearli', 'explain', 'waitress', 'ask', 'bring', 'second', 'empti', 'glass', 'waitress', 'came', 'back', 'return', 'two', 'rather', 'full', 'look', 'glass', 'wine', 'ask', 'one', 'glass', 'split', 'half', 'said', 'thought', 'order', 'two', 'glass', 'wine', 'ask', 'dish', 'recommend', 'alway', 'suggest', 'expens', 'two', 'option', 'happen', 'twice', 'seem', 'bit', 'suspici', 'review', 'mention', 'waitress', 'recommend', 'pound', 'fish', 'per', 'person', 'go', 'big', 'catch', 'fish', 'pound', 'smallest', 'pound', 'also', 'hve', 'care', 'price', 'fish', 'indic', 'special', 'chalkboard', 'ask', 'price', 'rang', 'reason', 'restaur', 'get', 'three', 'star', 'rather', 'two', 'food', 'three', 'us', 'order', 'gazpacho', 'worst', 'dish', 'meal', 'gazpacho', 'soup', 'seafood', 'garnish', 'shrimp', 'small', 'scallop', 'hunk', 'white', 'fish', 'ring', 'calamari', 'calamari', 'extrem', 'chewi', 'person', 'found', 'ined', 'flavour', 'gazpacho', 'base', 'decent', 'bit', 'kick', 'found', 'rather', 'salti', 'disgustingli', 'oili', 'couldnt', 'finish', 'would', 'never', 'order', 'dish', 'came', 'recommend', 'waitress', 'tuna', 'cesar', 'salad', 'decent', 'portion', 'friend', 'like', 'clam', 'linguin', 'anoth', 'good', 'size', 'portion', 'friend', 'finish', 'think', 'enjoy', 'bit', 'odd', 'give', 'spoon', 'linguin', 'side', 'plate', 'empti', 'shell', 'ask', 'sea', 'diver', 'scallop', 'sweet', 'pea', 'pure', 'bacon', 'garnish', 'friend', 'love', 'dish', 'said', 'would', 'definit', 'order', 'tri', 'bite', 'one', 'scallop', 'would', 'agre', 'quit', 'well', 'cook', 'roast', 'halibut', 'zucchini', 'leek', 'side', 'came', 'two', 'good', 'size', 'fillet', 'halibut', 'fish', 'cook', 'perfectli', 'zucchini', 'leek', 'side', 'consist', 'primarili', 'oliv', 'caper', 'find', 'much', 'zucchini', 'leek', 'might', 'would', 'order', 'came', 'back', 'restaur', 'saut', 'kale', 'spinach', 'roast', 'garlic', 'friend', 'order', 'side', 'scallop', 'bite', 'thought', 'green', 'fine', 'rather', 'flavourless', 'wouldnt', 'order', 'dish', 'would', 'tri', 'differ', 'side', 'instead', 'scallop', 'halibut', 'elev', 'restaur', 'two', 'star', 'three', 'mani', 'interest', 'restaur', 'area', 'new', 'one', 'constantli', 'open', 'wouldnt', 'go', 'back', 'catch', 'halibut', 'scallop', 'overal', 'disappoint', 'experi']
272	ghoPAg3mRflXmDvG2tw1Nw	SRN1uHVsChLJAR42ryKqYg	30cVbUJcsDpqaEM9V_axVQ	2	2014-05-11	"Today was my first time dining in Toronto's new Four Seasons, and I must say I was rather underwhelmed.

We arrived around 11 for an early lunch and were brought to our table. The decor is relatively modern, although it is starting to look a bit tired and shabby. Most of the chairs were starting to show quite a bit of wear on the fabric armrests and you could see that there was chipped paint on a number of their cabinets. 

The servers were pleasant and unobtrusive, but I got the sense that they did not exactly go out of their way to cater to the diners. Spoons were dropped, water refills could have been more frequent, etc.

For drinks we just had a coffee and a tea during lunch, and a cappuccino at the end of the meal. Both the coffee and tea arrived with small cookies on the saucer, but the cappuccino did not come with one. It was surprising to me that the green tea came with a biscuit while a cappuccino did not as you would be more likely to expect one with the cappuccino. The cappuccino also took an extremely long time to arrive. The server actually had to go back to check on it because it was so slow to arrive. We were joking that they must be milking their own cows and growing their own beans! I will note that the coffee and tea were both served as pots of coffee and pots of tea, which was appreciated.

We ordered two smoked salmon salads and a small lobster salad without the coconut.

The lobster salad was a decent portion and came with a small lobster-filled samosa. The flavour of the samosa filling was yummy, but the shell was overcooked and rather greasy. The salad is dressed in a very light vinaigrette and comes with some drops of aioli on the plate. I did not like the aioli and would have preferred the dish without it. There are also whole peppercorns pre-sprinkled over top of the salad, so be cautious if you are sensitive to pepper!

The smoked salmon salads were also enjoyed and they came with a bit of caviar sprinkled throughout as well as some large crisps of some sort on top. A lot of frisée is used, so if you don't like frisée, you may want to avoid this dish. One of my dining companions noted that they thought the salad could use a bit more dressing.

The bathrooms are a bit odd. They are located in the basement and are not wheelchair accessible. If you require wheelchair accessible washrooms, you have to take the elevator up a floor. Once inside the washroom, there are individual stalls with floor-to-ceiling doors and walls. The stalls themselves are quite dim, and I expected a light to come on automatically (I thought they might be motion-sensored), but both my dining companions had the same experience (in both the men's and ladies washrooms).

Overall the experience was adequate, but I would not rush back to dbar. There are many other restaurants in the area where you would receive better good and service at the same price point."	6	0	3	['today', 'first', 'time', 'dine', 'toronto', 'new', 'four', 'season', 'must', 'say', 'rather', 'underwhelmedw', 'arriv', 'around', 'earli', 'lunch', 'brought', 'tabl', 'decor', 'rel', 'modern', 'although', 'start', 'look', 'bit', 'tire', 'shabbi', 'chair', 'start', 'show', 'quit', 'bit', 'wear', 'fabric', 'armrest', 'could', 'see', 'chip', 'paint', 'number', 'cabinet', 'server', 'pleasant', 'unobtrus', 'got', 'sens', 'exactli', 'go', 'way', 'cater', 'diner', 'spoon', 'drop', 'water', 'refil', 'could', 'frequent', 'etcfor', 'drink', 'coffe', 'tea', 'lunch', 'cappuccino', 'end', 'meal', 'coffe', 'tea', 'arriv', 'small', 'cooki', 'saucer', 'cappuccino', 'come', 'one', 'surpris', 'green', 'tea', 'came', 'biscuit', 'cappuccino', 'would', 'like', 'expect', 'one', 'cappuccino', 'cappuccino', 'also', 'took', 'extrem', 'long', 'time', 'arriv', 'server', 'actual', 'go', 'back', 'check', 'slow', 'arriv', 'joke', 'must', 'milk', 'cow', 'grow', 'bean', 'note', 'coffe', 'tea', 'serv', 'pot', 'coffe', 'pot', 'tea', 'appreciatedw', 'order', 'two', 'smoke', 'salmon', 'salad', 'small', 'lobster', 'salad', 'without', 'coconutth', 'lobster', 'salad', 'decent', 'portion', 'came', 'small', 'lobsterfil', 'samosa', 'flavour', 'samosa', 'fill', 'yummi', 'shell', 'overcook', 'rather', 'greasi', 'salad', 'dress', 'light', 'vinaigrett', 'come', 'drop', 'aioli', 'plate', 'like', 'aioli', 'would', 'prefer', 'dish', 'without', 'also', 'whole', 'peppercorn', 'presprinkl', 'top', 'salad', 'cautiou', 'sensit', 'pepperth', 'smoke', 'salmon', 'salad', 'also', 'enjoy', 'came', 'bit', 'caviar', 'sprinkl', 'throughout', 'well', 'larg', 'crisp', 'sort', 'top', 'lot', 'frise', 'use', 'dont', 'like', 'frise', 'may', 'want', 'avoid', 'dish', 'one', 'dine', 'companion', 'note', 'thought', 'salad', 'could', 'use', 'bit', 'dressingth', 'bathroom', 'bit', 'odd', 'locat', 'basement', 'wheelchair', 'access', 'requir', 'wheelchair', 'access', 'washroom', 'take', 'elev', 'floor', 'insid', 'washroom', 'individu', 'stall', 'floortoceil', 'door', 'wall', 'stall', 'quit', 'dim', 'expect', 'light', 'come', 'automat', 'thought', 'might', 'motionsensor', 'dine', 'companion', 'experi', 'men', 'ladi', 'washroomsoveral', 'experi', 'adequ', 'would', 'rush', 'back', 'dbar', 'mani', 'restaur', 'area', 'would', 'receiv', 'better', 'good', 'servic', 'price', 'point']

This is your classic greasy spoon diner and certainly looks the part. However, it does not have the dirty \/ grimy feel that you may typically associate with a diner. It has bar seating along the left side where you can clearly see the cooks preparing your meal fresh to order and there are tables along the right hand side with a few booths at the back.

I arrived around 11:45, and while the restaurant was not packed, it was certainly busy and I was told to seat myself. 

The menu is quite broad with all of your typical greasy spoon \/ diner options, and they seem quite willing to accommodate any special requests. I like that you can ask for pretty much anything on the side, for example a single pancake or a single slice of French toast - no problem!

I ordered a fresh fruit plate with a side of rye toast and my friend ordered a more typical diner meal of eggs over easy with home fries, toast, bacon, and an order of French toast on the side. The fresh fruit plate consisted of a sliced banana, a few orange slices, a chopped gala apple, and some grapes. The grapes weren't the freshest, but I was still satisfied.

Service was fairly bare because there was only one waitress serving the entire place, but she was very pleasant and was happy to answer any questions we had. They forgot to give my friend maple syrup for his French toast, and when we asked for it she apologized and brought it right away.

Overall I would return, but wouldn't necessarily make a special trip to go here."	2	1	0	['mar', 'yong', 'eglinton', 'mani', 'year', 'ago', 'brunch', 'first', 'time', 'locat', 'supposedli', 'origin', 'mar', 'classic', 'greasi', 'spoon', 'diner', 'certainli', 'look', 'part', 'howev', 'dirti', 'grimi', 'feel', 'may', 'typic', 'associ', 'diner', 'bar', 'seat', 'along', 'left', 'side', 'clearli', 'see', 'cook', 'prepar', 'meal', 'fresh', 'order', 'tabl', 'along', 'right', 'hand', 'side', 'booth', 'backi', 'arriv', 'around', 'restaur', 'pack', 'certainli', 'busi', 'told', 'seat', 'menu', 'quit', 'broad', 'typic', 'greasi', 'spoon', 'diner', 'option', 'seem', 'quit', 'will', 'accommod', 'special', 'request', 'like', 'ask', 'pretti', 'much', 'anyth', 'side', 'exampl', 'singl', 'pancak', 'singl', 'slice', 'french', 'toast', 'problemi', 'order', 'fresh', 'fruit', 'plate', 'side', 'rye', 'toast', 'friend', 'order', 'typic', 'diner', 'meal', 'egg', 'easi', 'home', 'fri', 'toast', 'bacon', 'order', 'french', 'toast', 'side', 'fresh', 'fruit', 'plate', 'consist', 'slice', 'banana', 'orang', 'slice', 'chop', 'gala', 'appl', 'grape', 'grape', 'werent', 'freshest', 'still', 'satisfiedservic', 'fairli', 'bare', 'one', 'waitress', 'serv', 'entir', 'place', 'pleasant', 'happi', 'answer', 'question', 'forgot', 'give', 'friend', 'mapl', 'syrup', 'french', 'toast', 'ask', 'apolog', 'brought', 'right', 'awayoveral', 'would', 'return', 'wouldnt', 'necessarili', 'make', 'special', 'trip', 'go']

We were immediately greeted when we arrived and asked if we would like our coats taken. We were brought to our table and seated at a cozy booth which was perfect for our intimate occasion. Our waiter described the specials to us, and then was kind enough to say that he didn't want to rush us, but that he also had two large parties that had just arrived, so that we could get our orders in before these groups. I really appreciated that he took the time to tell us this!

All table members enjoyed their dishes. I ordered the grilled calamari (lunch size, not appetizer). It came with lots of calamari that was cooked well, although some pieces were slightly overcooked (not uncommon when grilling calamari) and drizzled with olive oil and garlic. It also came with polenta, asparagus, green beans, carrots, and roasted beets. The beets were delicious! My only complaint was that there was a bit too much olive oil on the calamari and the vegetables for my liking, but otherwise it was a great dish!

Throughout our meal we had superb service that had an air of quiet elegance, not the pompous over-the-top flair that you sometimes experience at higher end restaurants.

We had just been out for sushi for dinner and were looking for some place to have dessert. We stumbled across MoRoCo and the fun and girly decor enticed us to give it a try.

It wasn't particularly busy as it was brand new, but there was a group there celebrating a wedding event of some sort (it might have been a pre-bachelor party or something). Our server was very chatty, attentive, and answered our questions. One of our party cannot have gluten, so he was very good about checking with the kitchen to see if there were any items that she could have and he addressed all of her concerns.

The menu describes the treats so well that I had a hard time deciding, but ultimately I chose these chocolate banana filled spring rolls that were served with various chocolate and caramel dipping sauces. These were decadent! I have noticed that these are no longer on the menu, but they were rather pricy (it might have been $16 or $18 for 3 small rolls. As such, I would not make MoRoCo a regular destination, but it is certainly fun for a treat or a special occasion!

Overall we had a good time and I particularly liked how the name of the restaurant represents the owner's ""three passions in life"" - which is what our waiter told us. From the website, ""Mo for Montana, Ro for Rory & Co for Cocoa. Montana and Rory are the children and inspiration, of the creator of MoRoCo Chocolat."	2	1	1	['came', 'love', 'summer', 'even', 'friend', 'moroco', 'open', 'sushi', 'dinner', 'look', 'place', 'dessert', 'stumbl', 'across', 'moroco', 'fun', 'girli', 'decor', 'entic', 'us', 'give', 'tryit', 'wasnt', 'particularli', 'busi', 'brand', 'new', 'group', 'celebr', 'wed', 'event', 'sort', 'might', 'prebachelor', 'parti', 'someth', 'server', 'chatti', 'attent', 'answer', 'question', 'one', 'parti', 'cannot', 'gluten', 'good', 'check', 'kitchen', 'see', 'item', 'could', 'address', 'concernsth', 'menu', 'describ', 'treat', 'well', 'hard', 'time', 'decid', 'ultim', 'chose', 'chocol', 'banana', 'fill', 'spring', 'roll', 'serv', 'variou', 'chocol', 'caramel', 'dip', 'sauc', 'decad', 'notic', 'longer', 'menu', 'rather', 'prici', 'might', 'small', 'roll', 'would', 'make', 'moroco', 'regular', 'destin', 'certainli', 'fun', 'treat', 'special', 'occasionoveral', 'good', 'time', 'particularli', 'like', 'name', 'restaur', 'repres', 'owner', 'three', 'passion', 'life', 'waiter', 'told', 'us', 'websit', 'mo', 'montana', 'ro', 'rori', 'co', 'cocoa', 'montana', 'rori', 'children', 'inspir', 'creator', 'moroco', 'chocolat']

The restaurant itself is rather bare bones with limited decorations and plastic chopsticks and cups. The menu is also on the smaller side with fewer options than you may typically expect to find.

My friend ordered the special of the day which was beef teriyaki which came with rice, salad, and a croquette (fried potato ball with meat mixed in). I ordered a cucumber roll and the sunomono salad (seafood, seaweed, cucumber, and a sweet vinegar. The cucumber roll and salad came quickly and I decided to order a second order of the sunomono as the serving size appeared quite small. This second salad also appeared quickly. After waiting for about half an hour without any sign of my friend's food, we decided to inquire about it. It turns out that the waitress had not heard the order for the special of the day, so it had not been prepared. At this stage I was a bit confused about why the waitress had not come to check in on us earlier as we were sitting with three plates of untouched food in front of us for about 25 minutes (I had not touched my food as I was waiting for my friend to receive hers). Her plate came quickly after we fixed this mix up.

The cucumber roll was quite large (8 pieces) with a lot of rice and chunks of cucumber rather than the finely sliced slivers I typically expect. The seafood in the sunomono salad was crab meat and two pieces of shrimp. I found the dressing to be quite salty and one bowl contained considerably more dressing than the other. My friend said her beef teriyaki was good, although it wasn't an outstanding dish.

The smaller restaurant got rather busy during the lunch hour and the server was getting a bit overwhelmed as she was tending to everyone on her own. At one point, the female chef actually emerged from the back to bring out two dishes to patrons. 

Payment is also a bit confusing because some people paid at their tables whereas others went up to the counter to pay. We had to ask for our bill and the waitress asked us to come to the counter to pay.

Overall it probably is good authentic Japanese food, but I don't think I will be rushing back anytime soon. I was also disappointed that we were not offered complimentary green tea."	0	0	0	['went', 'lunch', 'today', 'seat', 'sweet', 'girl', 'friend', 'often', 'go', 'sushi', 'inn', 'decid', 'tri', 'tokyo', 'kitchen', 'first', 'time', 'suppos', 'authent', 'japanes', 'foodth', 'restaur', 'rather', 'bare', 'bone', 'limit', 'decor', 'plastic', 'chopstick', 'cup', 'menu', 'also', 'smaller', 'side', 'fewer', 'option', 'may', 'typic', 'expect', 'findmi', 'friend', 'order', 'special', 'day', 'beef', 'teriyaki', 'came', 'rice', 'salad', 'croquett', 'fri', 'potato', 'ball', 'meat', 'mix', 'order', 'cucumb', 'roll', 'sunomono', 'salad', 'seafood', 'seawe', 'cucumb', 'sweet', 'vinegar', 'cucumb', 'roll', 'salad', 'came', 'quickli', 'decid', 'order', 'second', 'order', 'sunomono', 'serv', 'size', 'appear', 'quit', 'small', 'second', 'salad', 'also', 'appear', 'quickli', 'wait', 'half', 'hour', 'without', 'sign', 'friend', 'food', 'decid', 'inquir', 'turn', 'waitress', 'heard', 'order', 'special', 'day', 'prepar', 'stage', 'bit', 'confus', 'waitress', 'come', 'check', 'us', 'earlier', 'sit', 'three', 'plate', 'untouch', 'food', 'front', 'us', 'minut', 'touch', 'food', 'wait', 'friend', 'receiv', 'plate', 'came', 'quickli', 'fix', 'mix', 'upth', 'cucumb', 'roll', 'quit', 'larg', 'piec', 'lot', 'rice', 'chunk', 'cucumb', 'rather', 'fine', 'slice', 'sliver', 'typic', 'expect', 'seafood', 'sunomono', 'salad', 'crab', 'meat', 'two', 'piec', 'shrimp', 'found', 'dress', 'quit', 'salti', 'one', 'bowl', 'contain', 'consider', 'dress', 'friend', 'said', 'beef', 'teriyaki', 'good', 'although', 'wasnt', 'outstand', 'dishth', 'smaller', 'restaur', 'got', 'rather', 'busi', 'lunch', 'hour', 'server', 'get', 'bit', 'overwhelm', 'tend', 'everyon', 'one', 'point', 'femal', 'chef', 'actual', 'emerg', 'back', 'bring', 'two', 'dish', 'patron', 'payment', 'also', 'bit', 'confus', 'peopl', 'paid', 'tabl', 'wherea', 'other', 'went', 'counter', 'pay', 'ask', 'bill', 'waitress', 'ask', 'us', 'come', 'counter', 'payoveral', 'probabl', 'good', 'authent', 'japanes', 'food', 'dont', 'think', 'rush', 'back', 'anytim', 'soon', 'also', 'disappoint', 'offer', 'complimentari', 'green', 'tea']

I don't often come here as there are other grocery stores closer to where I live. I found this store to be rather crowded and poorly organized. Items were not stocked on the shelves in a logical manner. Furthermore, the prices here are considerably higher than bigger grocery stores. For example, the crackers I wanted to buy we're selling for $4.19 vs $3.49 at the nearby sobeys, metro, and loblaws. 

One redeeming quality of the store was the take-away salad bar they had on offer. While I did not purchase anything, I noticed that there was a yummy looking seafood salad in the bar as well as some other interesting mixed salads that you would not typically find in your standard salad bar.

I would return here to try out that salad bar and maybe buy groceries - if the prices were more competitive!"	0	0	0	['came', 'yesterday', 'morn', 'look', 'ryvita', 'cracker', 'dont', 'often', 'come', 'groceri', 'store', 'closer', 'live', 'found', 'store', 'rather', 'crowd', 'poorli', 'organ', 'item', 'stock', 'shelv', 'logic', 'manner', 'furthermor', 'price', 'consider', 'higher', 'bigger', 'groceri', 'store', 'exampl', 'cracker', 'want', 'buy', 'sell', 'vs', 'nearbi', 'sobey', 'metro', 'loblaw', 'one', 'redeem', 'qualiti', 'store', 'takeaway', 'salad', 'bar', 'offer', 'purchas', 'anyth', 'notic', 'yummi', 'look', 'seafood', 'salad', 'bar', 'well', 'interest', 'mix', 'salad', 'would', 'typic', 'find', 'standard', 'salad', 'bari', 'would', 'return', 'tri', 'salad', 'bar', 'mayb', 'buy', 'groceri', 'price', 'competit']

We arrived around 6:15 and the lower level was about half full (there is also an upper level which I did not visit). We were seated by a waitress and greeted promptly by our server. They have an extensive beer and wine \/ cocktail menu. We did not look at their food menu as we were only having drinks, but the food that I saw passing our table all look really good, and I would be happy to return to try some of their dishes.

Our server was very pleasant and more than happy to provide drink recommendations and split our bills for us. I also enjoyed the slogan on the back of the servers' shirts: ""Come, sit, stay"" - a nice little play on words on dog commands.

We decided to try it out after hearing that there would be a wait for the patio at the Rebel House. They have a lovely patio at Doria  and a bright seating area inside with large, wide windows open to give the feeling as though you are sitting on their patio. 

The menu is fairly limited, generally featuring salads and pizzas with a few paninis. I got the funghi salad (mushrooms, parmesean, arugula, brown butter vinaigrette), which I believe was $12 (or it might have been $11). I asked to substitute tomatoes for the parmesean and for the vinaigrette to be switched to a balsamic and served on the side. The waitress assured me this would be possible and even checked with the chef first before confirming with me. When the salad arrived, there wasn't any parmesean, which was great, but there also weren't any tomatoes. In addition, the salad was covered with breadcrumbs (not listed on the menu), and the salad was oily, despite the fact that I asked for dressing on the side. Needless to say I was disappointed with my meal. 

Our server was pleasant, although she seemed rather young and wasn't particularly attentive. I liked that the kitchen was directly in the restaurant, and it was clear that everything was made to order.

I would return and would likely try a different dish."	0	0	1	['went', 'last', 'night', 'dinner', 'two', 'friend', 'decid', 'tri', 'hear', 'would', 'wait', 'patio', 'rebel', 'hous', 'love', 'patio', 'doria', 'bright', 'seat', 'area', 'insid', 'larg', 'wide', 'window', 'open', 'give', 'feel', 'though', 'sit', 'patio', 'menu', 'fairli', 'limit', 'gener', 'featur', 'salad', 'pizza', 'panini', 'got', 'funghi', 'salad', 'mushroom', 'parmesean', 'arugula', 'brown', 'butter', 'vinaigrett', 'believ', 'might', 'ask', 'substitut', 'tomato', 'parmesean', 'vinaigrett', 'switch', 'balsam', 'serv', 'side', 'waitress', 'assur', 'would', 'possibl', 'even', 'check', 'chef', 'first', 'confirm', 'salad', 'arriv', 'wasnt', 'parmesean', 'great', 'also', 'werent', 'tomato', 'addit', 'salad', 'cover', 'breadcrumb', 'list', 'menu', 'salad', 'oili', 'despit', 'fact', 'ask', 'dress', 'side', 'needless', 'say', 'disappoint', 'meal', 'server', 'pleasant', 'although', 'seem', 'rather', 'young', 'wasnt', 'particularli', 'attent', 'like', 'kitchen', 'directli', 'restaur', 'clear', 'everyth', 'made', 'orderi', 'would', 'return', 'would', 'like', 'tri', 'differ', 'dish']

First, I did not like the fact that frozen food was being displayed on the outdoor porch. Granted it is winter and it is frigidly cold out so the goods would be unlikely to spoil, I just still prefer to see my frozen groceries in a freezer! There is a distinctly 'fishy' odor at the back of the store where they sell the fresh fish, but it's not even a normal fish-stall smell... it's not like when you pass the fresh fish stands at St. Lawrence Market. I did not find that the prices here were considerably better than nearby Sobeys or Metro, so I would definitely not return just to save money. Something else that was off-putting was the fact that they charge you $0.50 to use credit cards if you spend less than $30. I can understand it to some extent when stores want you to spend at least $10, but $30 is a bit steep in my opinion!

It is still currently under renovations, so it was quite dusty and only one (of two) bathrooms was functioning and neither of the two shower stalls were open. 

The studio itself was quite nice and clean, but I do have some complaints. The first being that one wall is all windows to the outside with a bar set up along the windows, if you're unfortunate (like me) and end up at the bar along the window, it means you don't have access to a mirror to assess your position, etc. The instructor was nice and enthusiastic, but she described the positions verbally as she walked around and only sort of demonstrated the positions. When we were lying on our mats, it would have been nice if she had laid down at times too to demonstrate. At times I felt my muscles working hard and I remember thinking, ""wow, I'll feel this tomorrow"", but I don't feel it in my muscles today.

Oh yeah, probably because I don't want to let the cat out of the bag with this little gem! Certainly not a luxury spa, but it is clean and well maintained.

They start you off with a hot tea foot massage for about 15 minutes. During this time they will often offer you some tea or water.  It's great that they have free wifi, you just need to ask for the password if they don't offer it to you, After your foot soak, they wrap your feet in towels so that they don't get cold while you have your other foot massaged. 

The price here raelly can't be beat - well, it can because most of the other similar places along charge the same $30 for a 60 minute reflexology session; however, I have not found another place that compares to the quality of service I receive here. I am a major athlete, and they can give my feet the hard and firm massages necessary to provide relief. Don't get be wrong, it kills at the time, but it's worth it in the end!

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I do not know if too many people who spend 10 minutes in a glasses store where all of the glasses are in locked cabinets who do not need help.

I was greeted warmly by a lovely lady and told her I wanted a foot massage. She said it would be $30 for 60 minutes - 15 minute foot soak and 45 minute massage, which seems to be the going rate in the area. FYI - they do not accept credit or debit cards, it is cash only.  I agreed, and she brought into one of their rooms. It was not particularly luxurious - old chairs, open doorways, and half walls between the rooms. They brought in a bucket of warm water which had a tea bag in it, then left me to soak my feet. I appreciated that she brought me the wifi password, although it could have been because I had asked if they had wifi prior to agreeing to the service. My foot soak lasted for approximately 7-8 minutes befor my masseuse came in. First he started to scrape at my feet wiht his fingernails - in bare hands! He dried my feet \/ legs and began to slather them with vaseline and got to work.

Overall, I would say my experience was mediocre. It was only my second foot massage, but it was not as good as my first. I kept on asking the masseuse to use firmer pressure (go harder), but it did not seem to make any difference in what he was doing. The massage itself probably lasted around 35 minutes, so I was in and out in about 45 minutes. At the end, my feet and legs were a greasy mess, so I asked the lady if I could soak them again. For some reason she said that I couldn't, but offered me a warm wet towel instead. I took her up on this and she wiped down my legs for me. It was only when I was leaving that I was offered water or tea. This was a bit odd to me as I would have liked to enjoy those during the actual massage.

Given that there are so many other similar places in Chinatown that offer the 60 minute foot massages for $30, I will try another option before returning to Zhen Zhen."	8	2	2	['experi', 'zhen', 'zhen', 'live', 'post', 'past', 'review', 'yelp', 'greet', 'warmli', 'love', 'ladi', 'told', 'want', 'foot', 'massag', 'said', 'would', 'minut', 'minut', 'foot', 'soak', 'minut', 'massag', 'seem', 'go', 'rate', 'area', 'fyi', 'accept', 'credit', 'debit', 'card', 'cash', 'agre', 'brought', 'one', 'room', 'particularli', 'luxuri', 'old', 'chair', 'open', 'doorway', 'half', 'wall', 'room', 'brought', 'bucket', 'warm', 'water', 'tea', 'bag', 'left', 'soak', 'feet', 'appreci', 'brought', 'wifi', 'password', 'although', 'could', 'ask', 'wifi', 'prior', 'agre', 'servic', 'foot', 'soak', 'last', 'approxim', 'minut', 'befor', 'masseus', 'came', 'first', 'start', 'scrape', 'feet', 'wiht', 'fingernail', 'bare', 'hand', 'dri', 'feet', 'leg', 'began', 'slather', 'vaselin', 'got', 'workoveral', 'would', 'say', 'experi', 'mediocr', 'second', 'foot', 'massag', 'good', 'first', 'kept', 'ask', 'masseus', 'use', 'firmer', 'pressur', 'go', 'harder', 'seem', 'make', 'differ', 'massag', 'probabl', 'last', 'around', 'minut', 'minut', 'end', 'feet', 'leg', 'greasi', 'mess', 'ask', 'ladi', 'could', 'soak', 'reason', 'said', 'couldnt', 'offer', 'warm', 'wet', 'towel', 'instead', 'took', 'wipe', 'leg', 'leav', 'offer', 'water', 'tea', 'bit', 'odd', 'would', 'like', 'enjoy', 'actual', 'massagegiven', 'mani', 'similar', 'place', 'chinatown', 'offer', 'minut', 'foot', 'massag', 'tri', 'anoth', 'option', 'return', 'zhen', 'zhen']

Everything is well organized and easy to find. I do not shop for clothing items there often, so I can't comment on the selection. I find that they have a good housewares and kitchen area and you can find good deals there. I also like looking at their food selection as you can find unique items (e.g. sauces, dressings, spices) at decent prices. This store also has clean washrooms, which are a bonus. I prefer this Marshall's to the Winners that is just up the block. I find that the Winners is much busier and the items are strewn everywhere so it is hard to find items and it is not as pleasant of a shopping experience.	1	0	0	['realli', 'like', 'marshal', 'year', 'old', 'clean', 'bright', 'everyth', 'well', 'organ', 'easi', 'find', 'shop', 'cloth', 'item', 'often', 'cant', 'comment', 'select', 'find', 'good', 'housewar', 'kitchen', 'area', 'find', 'good', 'deal', 'also', 'like', 'look', 'food', 'select', 'find', 'uniqu', 'item', 'eg', 'sauc', 'dress', 'spice', 'decent', 'price', 'store', 'also', 'clean', 'washroom', 'bonu', 'prefer', 'marshal', 'winner', 'block', 'find', 'winner', 'much', 'busier', 'item', 'strewn', 'everywher', 'hard', 'find', 'item', 'pleasant', 'shop', 'experi']

I only ordered a tea, so I can't comment on the quality if the food, but they did have a number if pre-made salads and sandwiches from their grab and go bar which looked quite tasty.

I can comment on the service though, something I found to be a little unfortunate. While the waitress was adequate, she was not particularly pleasant or helpful. I had to wait for some time at the cash for her to take my order as she had her back to me. When she did turn around, all she said was ""what do you want"". Not a very pleasant greeting. I asked her what type of teas they had and she said ""they're over there"", pointing me toward a row of canisters of loose leaf teas, turning her back on me again and leaving me to read the names and descriptions of each one. I then asked what she would recommend between the baked apple and the green lime tea, to which she replied, ""one's apple and one's lime"". Again, not particularly helpful. 

I decided to get the lime tea and it was good enough. I was pleased with the price though - $1.50 for a loose leaf tea - it beats Starbucks pricing!

The restaurant is fairly small with a bar taking up about one half of the space. It's a dimly lit interior with a bit of a rustic Asian feel. 

The menu is quite extensive including bibimbap, side dishes, and grilled dishes with some unique offerings. I decided to play it fairly safe and I ordered the following items:

1) Black Tiger Shrimp Grill - this came with four decently sized pieces of shrimp that were cooked well, but were not particularly flavourful and weren't  too special 
2) Vegetable Jap Chae - this is a dish of sweet potato noodles and vegetables. I didn't like it very much. I found it to be pretty oily and flavourless. It also didn't come with many vegetables and was mainly just slivers of onions with a few pieces of peppers and a few pieces of mushrooms. I wouldn't get it again.

Others ordered the vegetable skewers which looked good. I found it interesting that they came with pieces of corn on the cob. Some of the other meat pieces that my friends ordered looked a little sparse. For example, the chicken skewers didn't look like they came with much meat on them.

Service was sufficient, although we all noted that they could have been better at refilling our drinks. It was also a bit frustrating how there were sometimes significant time lags between when different people got their dishes (which may be just a feature of dining at a yakitori style restaurant), meaning that some people had finished their meals while others were just starting on theirs.

Ultimately we had a fun evening and my friends commented that they would return, but we wouldn't rush back, and I would not consider it a group favourite."	0	0	0	['came', 'group', 'seven', 'peopl', 'dinner', 'tri', 'someth', 'new', 'yakitori', 'restaur', 'fairli', 'small', 'bar', 'take', 'one', 'half', 'space', 'dimli', 'lit', 'interior', 'bit', 'rustic', 'asian', 'feel', 'menu', 'quit', 'extens', 'includ', 'bibimbap', 'side', 'dish', 'grill', 'dish', 'uniqu', 'offer', 'decid', 'play', 'fairli', 'safe', 'order', 'follow', 'item', 'black', 'tiger', 'shrimp', 'grill', 'came', 'four', 'decent', 'size', 'piec', 'shrimp', 'cook', 'well', 'particularli', 'flavour', 'werent', 'special', 'veget', 'jap', 'chae', 'dish', 'sweet', 'potato', 'noodl', 'veget', 'didnt', 'like', 'much', 'found', 'pretti', 'oili', 'flavourless', 'also', 'didnt', 'come', 'mani', 'veget', 'mainli', 'sliver', 'onion', 'piec', 'pepper', 'piec', 'mushroom', 'wouldnt', 'get', 'againoth', 'order', 'veget', 'skewer', 'look', 'good', 'found', 'interest', 'came', 'piec', 'corn', 'cob', 'meat', 'piec', 'friend', 'order', 'look', 'littl', 'spars', 'exampl', 'chicken', 'skewer', 'didnt', 'look', 'like', 'came', 'much', 'meat', 'themservic', 'suffici', 'although', 'note', 'could', 'better', 'refil', 'drink', 'also', 'bit', 'frustrat', 'sometim', 'signific', 'time', 'lag', 'differ', 'peopl', 'got', 'dish', 'may', 'featur', 'dine', 'yakitori', 'style', 'restaur', 'mean', 'peopl', 'finish', 'meal', 'other', 'start', 'theirsultim', 'fun', 'even', 'friend', 'comment', 'would', 'return', 'wouldnt', 'rush', 'back', 'would', 'consid', 'group', 'favourit']

One thing I will mention is that when my friends were trying to pick the final dish that they were going to order in their collection of tapas (being vegan, I did not participate), the server only really suggested the two most expensive items on the menu, which were significantly more expensive than the other tapas - the seafood dish and the ribeye (around $28 and $54, respectively).

It turns out that we picked a good day to try out Pogue Mahone as it was their summer patio kick off party. They were giving out lots of free samples of food (fish tacos, corn dogs, nachos, etc.) and free drinks (sangria, shots of Honey Jack, beer, etc.). Although I didn't try any of the food, it looked good, and it appeared to be a step above traditional 'pub grub'.

There was also live music on the patio. Unfortunately the music was much too loud, which made it difficult to carry out a conversation with my friend. In addition, I found that the tables were a bit too close together, and we had a rowdy couple at the table beside ours, so this detracted from our experience, but I guess that's to be expected on a pub's patio on a beautiful Friday evening.

We were promptly seated at a booth at the back of the restaurant. The ambiance is nice, but a bit odd because it seems to be a mix of a semi-upscale restaurant with a bar with big screen TVs. 

As I was planning on having Thai food that night I decided to have their Mild Thai Curry Bowl (Chicken & shrimp, sweet peppers, green onions, seasonal vegetables, nappa and bok choy with mild Thai curry sauce, served on jasmine rice in a fresh cut pineapple bowl. Garnished with fresh pineapple $18.50). I had asked if it could be made extra spicy and our waitress said that it would be possible, so I was excited to try this dish. 

The food was presented inside of a pineapple slices in half. What I had not realized was that the rice would be in the bottom of the pineapple with the sauce and meat \/ vegetables on top. I didn't really like this dish as I found that the sauce was not very flavourful and it certainly was not spicy. I would not order this dish again.

As we were a group of friends from camp we decided that it would only be fitting for us to try out the table-top s'mores for dessert. This was a fun dish to share and a unique experience.

I went for lunch one day and ordered the spinach and chickpea wrap from their deli counter. I have ordered this wrap many times before and have always really enjoyed it. I asked for it to be grilled twice (like I always do) because sometimes I find the inside is still a bit cold if it is only grilled once as it sits in the deli fridge. The first half of my wrap was great, as usual, but after the first bite of the second half I noticed something that looked like a short black hair inside my wrap. I was a bit torn about what to do, but after deciding that I did believe this was a hair, I brought it to the cashier to inspect. She called the lady at the deli counter over to examine. This lady was trying to convince me that it wasn't a hair, but was in fact just a stringy bit of spinach. I can understand that spinach sometimes gets stringy when cooked, but this was much too fine, and was slightly curly - like a hair. Eventually this lady brought the deli counter manager over who similarly tried to convince me that it was not a hair. I wasn't being particularly opinionated, but the workers were being quite insistent. After a few minutes, the manager begrudgingly said, ""I really don't think this is a hair, but I guess I'll get you another wrap if you want.""

I was not necessarily looking for another wrap, but an apology certainly would have been nice at the very least.

This is considered to be a high-end grocery store, and to receive that kind of customer service was off-putting.

I had a tea, which was less expensive than a  typical Starbucks or Second Cup tea, but they didn't have a wide variety of tea choices. I didn't get anything to eat so I can't comment on the food, although I did notice a bunch of baked goods and some treats from the well-known bakery on Bayview, Rahier. They also carried a range of soups and sandwiches if you want to grab something for lunch. 

It has the air of trying to be a cafe in France, but it doesn't quite hit the mark. The bathrooms are a bit on the grungy side though (slightly more commiserate with what you might find in France!).

We played trampoline dodgeball for a half an hour, and we exhausted after that! We were surprised at how tiring it could be. Then we had the chance to trampoline into their foam pits (filled with foam blocks, NOT shaving cream foam as I initially thought when I heard 'foam pit') and play with their trampoline basketballs. These were entertaining, but the dodgeball was way more fun.

The centre is used by a big mix of people. We were there on a Saturday afternoon, so there were lots of kids running around and birthday parties going on. The centre also has trampoline dodgeball leagues so there were many adults there ready to get their game on!

One complaint I would have is their washrooms - only two or three stalls in the ladies room and is was not particularly clean.

It was a scorching hot Toronto day, so I was happy that the restaurant was well air conditioned! The setting is pretty basic but looked a bit outdated.

1st course: shrimp with cocktail sauce - I love seafood so was eager to try this dish, but I was quite disappointed. The shrimp were very dry and did not taste fresh. It was clear that the dish had been premise and was sitting with cellophane over top waiting to be served.

2nd course: chicken with mango salsa - this dish was fine. It is hard to mess up basic chicken and mango salsa, so no complaints here.

Dessert - chocolate cake. I was trying to decide between their chocolate cake and the lemon tart, so I asked our waiter for his opinion. He said that the lemon tart wasn't very good, which made my decision easier, but it is always a bit alarming when a server does not recommend a dish (although it is something I appreciate!).

I came with two other diners, one if whom was both vegan and following a gluten-free diet. Our server was very good about informing her which dishes she could have and she went back to the kitchen to ask if she was not sure.

The dishes we ordered included the Thai red curry with tofu (vegan and gluten-free), the curry lunch special of the day (comes with chicken), the Thai cold shrimp rolls and the mango salad. 

Everyone really enjoyed their meals, and my two dining companions who had not been to Sukho Thai before both agreed to return; however, there were a few small glitches that prevented Sukho Thai from receiving the full five stars on this review.

1) The lunch curry special of the day cones with a considerably smaller portion of curry than you would receive with the full sized portion. Granted, it does cost less than the full sized dishes; however, when it is promoted as the special of the day, you think you are receiving a deal or good pricing. It would be nice if the lunch menu indicated that the servings were lunch sized portions.

2) One diner ordered the Thai cold shrimp rolls and the mango salad as their main course. This dishes arrived about five minutes before the other two dishes, which isn't a big deal because they are cold dishes so don't need to be eaten immediately, but it's still a bit awkward to have them sitting on the table while you wait for the other meals to arrive. These dishes could easily have been held back in the kitchen until the other diners' meals were ready, and then all of the meals could be brought out together.

3) While service was attentive during our meal, we had a hard time tracking down our waitress once she had cleared our plates and we wanted to pay our bills.

Overall it was a satisfying lunch and I will return. I would recommend making reservations before you arrive - you don't want to disappoint your Thai craving if you are faced with a wait!

One bonus of Sukho Thai is that it does take reservations and has incredibly similar (if not identical) dishes to Khao San Road (as they used to be owned by the same people) which does not take reservations and you may encounter a two hour wait for a table there!"	1	0	0	['sukho', 'thai', 'dinner', 'order', 'deliveri', 'first', 'time', 'go', 'lunch', 'review', 'base', 'lunch', 'experiencei', 'came', 'two', 'diner', 'one', 'vegan', 'follow', 'glutenfre', 'diet', 'server', 'good', 'inform', 'dish', 'could', 'went', 'back', 'kitchen', 'ask', 'sureth', 'dish', 'order', 'includ', 'thai', 'red', 'curri', 'tofu', 'vegan', 'glutenfre', 'curri', 'lunch', 'special', 'day', 'come', 'chicken', 'thai', 'cold', 'shrimp', 'roll', 'mango', 'salad', 'everyon', 'realli', 'enjoy', 'meal', 'two', 'dine', 'companion', 'sukho', 'thai', 'agre', 'return', 'howev', 'small', 'glitch', 'prevent', 'sukho', 'thai', 'receiv', 'full', 'five', 'star', 'review', 'lunch', 'curri', 'special', 'day', 'cone', 'consider', 'smaller', 'portion', 'curri', 'would', 'receiv', 'full', 'size', 'portion', 'grant', 'cost', 'less', 'full', 'size', 'dish', 'howev', 'promot', 'special', 'day', 'think', 'receiv', 'deal', 'good', 'price', 'would', 'nice', 'lunch', 'menu', 'indic', 'serv', 'lunch', 'size', 'portion', 'one', 'diner', 'order', 'thai', 'cold', 'shrimp', 'roll', 'mango', 'salad', 'main', 'cours', 'dish', 'arriv', 'five', 'minut', 'two', 'dish', 'isnt', 'big', 'deal', 'cold', 'dish', 'dont', 'need', 'eaten', 'immedi', 'still', 'bit', 'awkward', 'sit', 'tabl', 'wait', 'meal', 'arriv', 'dish', 'could', 'easili', 'held', 'back', 'kitchen', 'diner', 'meal', 'readi', 'meal', 'could', 'brought', 'togeth', 'servic', 'attent', 'meal', 'hard', 'time', 'track', 'waitress', 'clear', 'plate', 'want', 'pay', 'billsoveral', 'satisfi', 'lunch', 'return', 'would', 'recommend', 'make', 'reserv', 'arriv', 'dont', 'want', 'disappoint', 'thai', 'crave', 'face', 'waiton', 'bonu', 'sukho', 'thai', 'take', 'reserv', 'incred', 'similar', 'ident', 'dish', 'khao', 'san', 'road', 'use', 'own', 'peopl', 'take', 'reserv', 'may', 'encount', 'two', 'hour', 'wait', 'tabl']

First, we had a reservation for 7 but were not seated until about 7:30. That wasn't a problem, as it was a nice night and we sat on a bench outside and perused the menus. Shortly after being seated (just after getting our water glasses filled and before placing our drink order), the hostess popped by and said, ""Just to let you know, we need your table for a reservation at 8:30."" .... ummm excuse me?! We just sat down, and you expect us to finish our meal in an hour?! So I guess we're just going to be rushed through are food and shouldn't expect to be able to order an appetizer, main, and dessert, if we want?! Clearly we were not too pleased with this statement. When one of the waiters passed our table we asked if we could be moved to a different table that we would not be required to vacate in an hour and that was away from the windows (tip: you can feel a draft by the windows, so wouldn't want to sit near them in the winter). This waiter went off to check for us. Then a different waiter appeared to take our drink order and we explained our request. At this point, someone (who I assume was one of the managers) stuck his head in and briskly told us that things were taken care of and we would not have to leave by 8:30. Great! We were finally able to enjoy our evening. A further note on the service - after the initial rocky start to our meal, it would have been nice if the manager had checked in on us again later to make sure we were enjoying ourselves, but alas, that did not occur.

Decor: refined casual - think gold framed pictures, accents of pastel colours, and a certain feminine flare to the room. It's definitely more elegant in appearance than Khao San Road, Sukho Thai, Pai, or Sabai Sabai.

Food: matching the decor, also more refined than any of the chef's other restaurants. I wanted to order a tea to drink, but they didn't have any hot water yet... weird. Rather than make this statement for every dish, I'm just going to say outright that I think the dishes are overpriced. Yes, they are unique, but I thought everything was overpriced considering the serving size (except the mussels). We ordered:

1) Mun Tawt Ruammit ($9) - taro root, sweet potato, and zucchini chips sprinkled with Tom yum spices. Personally I didn't taste much of the Tom yum and actually found them to be quite salty. 

2) Pad Buab Jae ($10) - Sliced gourd with garlic and basil. I really enjoyed this dish. There are many layers to the flavour of this dish with a strong smokey element. We both agreed that we would have preferred it had the gourd been crunchy or crispy. 

3) Hoi Nung Ta Krai ($14) - Roasted mussels with lemongrass broth. Phenomenal. So delicious and most definitely worth the price! And the way it is served is just gorgeous! This was by far my favourite dish. I just kept going back for more!

4) Khao Yum ($24) - this is essentially a flavoured rice dish. Yes, it's gorgeous and includes some interesting components (pomelo, kaffir lime, and fried chili to list a few), but it's maybe one and a half cups of rice total and maybe 1-2 tbsp of each seasoning. I'm glad I ordered it once for the photo, but I wouldn't order it again. The waiter was right though - the photo does turn out better with flash!


5) Dessert ($15) - they only had one dessert option on the night that we went, and it was a fruit platter. This consisted of two wedges of pomelo, four lychees, two mangosteens, and about 1\/4 of a mango. The pomelo was so fresh and delicious, but I'm biased because pomelo is quite possibly my favourite fruit and it has been out of season for awhile, so I'm always happy to get some. Save your money on dessert and grab something special elsewhere.

Although overpriced, I will still return because the food was yummy, and I hope they have the kinks (in the service and the hot water) worked out by then!"	3	0	2	['came', 'dinner', 'saturday', 'night', 'impress', 'initi', 'food', 'made', 'worth', 'whilefirst', 'reserv', 'seat', 'wasnt', 'problem', 'nice', 'night', 'sat', 'bench', 'outsid', 'perus', 'menu', 'shortli', 'seat', 'get', 'water', 'glass', 'fill', 'place', 'drink', 'order', 'hostess', 'pop', 'said', 'let', 'know', 'need', 'tabl', 'reserv', 'ummm', 'excus', 'sat', 'expect', 'us', 'finish', 'meal', 'hour', 'guess', 'go', 'rush', 'food', 'shouldnt', 'expect', 'abl', 'order', 'appet', 'main', 'dessert', 'want', 'clearli', 'pleas', 'statement', 'one', 'waiter', 'pass', 'tabl', 'ask', 'could', 'move', 'differ', 'tabl', 'would', 'requir', 'vacat', 'hour', 'away', 'window', 'tip', 'feel', 'draft', 'window', 'wouldnt', 'want', 'sit', 'near', 'winter', 'waiter', 'went', 'check', 'us', 'differ', 'waiter', 'appear', 'take', 'drink', 'order', 'explain', 'request', 'point', 'someon', 'assum', 'one', 'manag', 'stuck', 'head', 'briskli', 'told', 'us', 'thing', 'taken', 'care', 'would', 'leav', 'great', 'final', 'abl', 'enjoy', 'even', 'note', 'servic', 'initi', 'rocki', 'start', 'meal', 'would', 'nice', 'manag', 'check', 'us', 'later', 'make', 'sure', 'enjoy', 'ala', 'occurdecor', 'refin', 'casual', 'think', 'gold', 'frame', 'pictur', 'accent', 'pastel', 'colour', 'certain', 'feminin', 'flare', 'room', 'definit', 'eleg', 'appear', 'khao', 'san', 'road', 'sukho', 'thai', 'pai', 'sabai', 'sabaifood', 'match', 'decor', 'also', 'refin', 'chef', 'restaur', 'want', 'order', 'tea', 'drink', 'didnt', 'hot', 'water', 'yet', 'weird', 'rather', 'make', 'statement', 'everi', 'dish', 'im', 'go', 'say', 'outright', 'think', 'dish', 'overpr', 'ye', 'uniqu', 'thought', 'everyth', 'overpr', 'consid', 'serv', 'size', 'except', 'mussel', 'order', 'mun', 'tawt', 'ruammit', 'taro', 'root', 'sweet', 'potato', 'zucchini', 'chip', 'sprinkl', 'tom', 'yum', 'spice', 'person', 'didnt', 'tast', 'much', 'tom', 'yum', 'actual', 'found', 'quit', 'salti', 'pad', 'buab', 'jae', 'slice', 'gourd', 'garlic', 'basil', 'realli', 'enjoy', 'dish', 'mani', 'layer', 'flavour', 'dish', 'strong', 'smokey', 'element', 'agre', 'would', 'prefer', 'gourd', 'crunchi', 'crispi', 'hoi', 'nung', 'ta', 'krai', 'roast', 'mussel', 'lemongrass', 'broth', 'phenomen', 'delici', 'definit', 'worth', 'price', 'way', 'serv', 'gorgeou', 'far', 'favourit', 'dish', 'kept', 'go', 'back', 'khao', 'yum', 'essenti', 'flavour', 'rice', 'dish', 'ye', 'gorgeou', 'includ', 'interest', 'compon', 'pomelo', 'kaffir', 'lime', 'fri', 'chili', 'list', 'mayb', 'one', 'half', 'cup', 'rice', 'total', 'mayb', 'tbsp', 'season', 'im', 'glad', 'order', 'photo', 'wouldnt', 'order', 'waiter', 'right', 'though', 'photo', 'turn', 'better', 'flash', 'dessert', 'one', 'dessert', 'option', 'night', 'went', 'fruit', 'platter', 'consist', 'two', 'wedg', 'pomelo', 'four', 'lyche', 'two', 'mangosteen', 'mango', 'pomelo', 'fresh', 'delici', 'im', 'bias', 'pomelo', 'quit', 'possibl', 'favourit', 'fruit', 'season', 'awhil', 'im', 'alway', 'happi', 'get', 'save', 'money', 'dessert', 'grab', 'someth', 'special', 'elsewherealthough', 'overpr', 'still', 'return', 'food', 'yummi', 'hope', 'kink', 'servic', 'hot', 'water', 'work']

We ordered one of their trios of appetizers as a starter - the bean\/grain salad, the beets, and the kale hummus. The beets were delicious, perfectly cooked - not too hard or too mushy. The beans \/ grains dish has a bit of an Indian curry flavour to it, so caution if you don't like that taste. I personally didn't like the kale hummus. I found it to be too bitter tasting, but my dining companion really liked it. I ordered the mixed greens salad and some of the Baby greens were wilty. The pasta was a quite a large serving. More than enough to take home leftovers and have a full meal the next day.

There isn't much ambiance to this place. It kind of looks like an old run down bar that they've converted into a restaurant. On the plus side, they do accept American Express! 

They have lots of options for people with all sorts of tastes and the menu is well labeled with dietary options for any type of diet. Another word of advice - the menu in house is slightly different than the one online.

She brought multiple colours to the station and tested them out on my fingernails. She then set up my massage chair for me and brought me a selection of the most recent tabloid magazines. I really appreciated that she did not gawk at the atrocious condition of my feet (I'm a runner), and when I tried to apologize for them, she said it was no problem at all in a very sincere way and I actually felt like she meant it. She treated my feet with great care.

The salon is very clean and they open a new package of instruments for each client that they can then keep in the client's own box. I brought my own cuticle cutters and she was more than willing to use them, and cleaned them for me after.

We arrived around noon and the restaurant was about 50% full. I started to notice that it got pretty busy with the lunch crowd around 12:30, so unless you're planning on doing take out, it might be a good idea to arrive a bit earlier so you can grab a table.

Our cashier was a bit clueless. My friend asked if they had cheddar cheese available as all she wanted was cheese slices on toast. The cashier said that they did have cheddar cheese, but said she needed to ask how to ring in the order. We found this a bit odd because it clearly says on their menu that options include bread for $1 and cheese for $2. So wouldn't cheese and toast qualify as those two options? Our cashier asked another server and the server indicated that they did not actually have cheddar cheese. Then it took our server three attempts to accurately confirm our order - at one point she actually thought that we had also ordered an avocado sandwich.

They have an extensive menu with a number of healthy options available. I really liked how there are lots of combos to choose from and lots of ways to customize your meal. We both selected the red lentil soup, which was one of their two soups of the day (the other was butternut squash). The soup is just over $5 and comes with two halves of bread (choice of white, whole wheat, and multigrain) and little container of packaged butter on the side. The soup was quite good; however, it was rather chunky as the lentils are barely (if at all) puréed. I prefer my lentil soups to be smoother, but this is a matter of personal preference. I noticed that there were other vegetables in the soup too like carrots, onions, and tomatoes. It was also noted that the soup is vegan. We both ordered whole wheat bread and the slices were very thick and fluffy. It was clear that the bread was fresh!

The restaurant is clean and service is quick.

The restaurant is quite large. It is clean, spacious, modern, and dimly lit. They have both an AYCE menu (I believe around $19-20) as well as an a la carte option. We decided to order a la carte as we were a small group and not particularly hungry. The menu also has a number of unique rolls and dishes that you would not necessarily find at typical sushi bars. I ordered the following dishes:

1) Fushimi Salad ($3.5 - assorted seafood, cucumber, green onion, with homemade sauce) - the only seafood I found was bits if calamari, and it was only small pieces of tentacles, not the nice smooth pieces if the squid's body. Given that the menu said 'assorted seafood' I was also hoping for some shrimp or crabmeat, but alas, did not have any. The dressing had a bit of a kick to it, was rather salty, and there was just too much dressing - the cucumbers were drenched! I wouldn't order this dish again.

2) Shrimp Asparagus ($5 - cooked shrimp and asparagus with yuzu miso sauce) - this was four pieces of shrimp settled upon four spears of cooked asparagus. I would order this dish again and it was my favourite of the night.

3) Eggplant Roll ($4, 4 pieces - eggplant, lettuce, cucumber, with house sauce) - warning: the eggplant is tempura eggplant! I wish the menu had said this as I do not like tempura and would not have ordered this dish had I known. Nevertheless, I had one piece.

4) Cucumber Roll - because I did not like the eggplant roll, I decided to order a standard cucumber roll as it was a dish where I knew I would not be surprised with tempura again! It was a typical cucumber roll, although I found that there was too much rice (same with the eggplant roll).

My friends also enjoyed the dishes that they had ordered. The serving sizes are quite generous here and everything is presented artfully. A dish of wasabi and ginger was brought to the table before we had even ordered. I didn't particularly like this as it meant that these items were not freshly served, and these were communal dishes meant to be shared by everyone at the table.

I am struggling with what to say regarding the service. Our server was very sweet and brought water to the table immediately. Although green tea was complimentary, you had to ask for it, and it was served in typical coffee mugs, not the little green tea cups. There were definitely some language issues with our server as she was not able to explain what was in the fushimi salad and I had asked for the house sauce on my eggplant roll to come on the side, but when she brought it to the table, she explained that she had forgotten and asked if I wanted a new roll. It was hard to turn down the roll once it had already come to the table. In addition I was surprised that she didn't ask about the fact that I had only eaten one of the four pieces of the eggplant roll. It would have been appreciated if she had asked and realized that I did not like the dish and then removed it from the bill. 

Although there were a few snags in my meal, this is a restaurant I would come back to in order to try some of their other dishes.

Some additional notes:
1) They don't accept American Express
2) The bathrooms are co-ed - it's a series of single stalls with shared sinks and the stalls' doors are made of frosted glass."	2	0	0	['came', 'earli', 'dinner', 'friend', 'wednesday', 'night', 'none', 'us', 'ever', 'decid', 'tri', 'chang', 'usual', 'sushi', 'restaurantsth', 'restaur', 'quit', 'larg', 'clean', 'spaciou', 'modern', 'dimli', 'lit', 'ayc', 'menu', 'believ', 'around', 'well', 'la', 'cart', 'option', 'decid', 'order', 'la', 'cart', 'small', 'group', 'particularli', 'hungri', 'menu', 'also', 'number', 'uniqu', 'roll', 'dish', 'would', 'necessarili', 'find', 'typic', 'sushi', 'bar', 'order', 'follow', 'dish', 'fushimi', 'salad', 'assort', 'seafood', 'cucumb', 'green', 'onion', 'homemad', 'sauc', 'seafood', 'found', 'bit', 'calamari', 'small', 'piec', 'tentacl', 'nice', 'smooth', 'piec', 'squid', 'bodi', 'given', 'menu', 'said', 'assort', 'seafood', 'also', 'hope', 'shrimp', 'crabmeat', 'ala', 'dress', 'bit', 'kick', 'rather', 'salti', 'much', 'dress', 'cucumb', 'drench', 'wouldnt', 'order', 'dish', 'shrimp', 'asparagu', 'cook', 'shrimp', 'asparagu', 'yuzu', 'miso', 'sauc', 'four', 'piec', 'shrimp', 'settl', 'upon', 'four', 'spear', 'cook', 'asparagu', 'would', 'order', 'dish', 'favourit', 'night', 'eggplant', 'roll', 'piec', 'eggplant', 'lettuc', 'cucumb', 'hous', 'sauc', 'warn', 'eggplant', 'tempura', 'eggplant', 'wish', 'menu', 'said', 'like', 'tempura', 'would', 'order', 'dish', 'known', 'nevertheless', 'one', 'piec', 'cucumb', 'roll', 'like', 'eggplant', 'roll', 'decid', 'order', 'standard', 'cucumb', 'roll', 'dish', 'knew', 'would', 'surpris', 'tempura', 'typic', 'cucumb', 'roll', 'although', 'found', 'much', 'rice', 'eggplant', 'rollmi', 'friend', 'also', 'enjoy', 'dish', 'order', 'serv', 'size', 'quit', 'gener', 'everyth', 'present', 'art', 'dish', 'wasabi', 'ginger', 'brought', 'tabl', 'even', 'order', 'didnt', 'particularli', 'like', 'meant', 'item', 'freshli', 'serv', 'commun', 'dish', 'meant', 'share', 'everyon', 'tablei', 'struggl', 'say', 'regard', 'servic', 'server', 'sweet', 'brought', 'water', 'tabl', 'immedi', 'although', 'green', 'tea', 'complimentari', 'ask', 'serv', 'typic', 'coffe', 'mug', 'littl', 'green', 'tea', 'cup', 'definit', 'languag', 'issu', 'server', 'abl', 'explain', 'fushimi', 'salad', 'ask', 'hous', 'sauc', 'eggplant', 'roll', 'come', 'side', 'brought', 'tabl', 'explain', 'forgotten', 'ask', 'want', 'new', 'roll', 'hard', 'turn', 'roll', 'alreadi', 'come', 'tabl', 'addit', 'surpris', 'didnt', 'ask', 'fact', 'eaten', 'one', 'four', 'piec', 'eggplant', 'roll', 'would', 'appreci', 'ask', 'realiz', 'like', 'dish', 'remov', 'bill', 'although', 'snag', 'meal', 'restaur', 'would', 'come', 'back', 'order', 'tri', 'dishessom', 'addit', 'note', 'dont', 'accept', 'american', 'express', 'bathroom', 'co', 'seri', 'singl', 'stall', 'share', 'sink', 'stall', 'door', 'made', 'frost', 'glass']

I came here on a Friday night. There was a guy playing some blues on their front patio. They have a back patio but I didn't check it out. You have to go inside to serve yourself at the bar. The servers were pretty clueless. I asked for a glass of their chardonnay and the guy didn't know whether or not they had any. He didn't even check the bar without saying that, and the wine fridge was right behind him. I then wanted to pay for my glass of wine with Visa. This actually probably took around 10 minutes to process, and at the end of it all it turned out that they can't take the combined Visa-debit cards so be forewarned about that! I ended up paying in cash. I paid $15 ($8 for my wine and $7 for my friend's beer. I gave them a $20 and they gave me a $5 bill - which is fair enough, but it made it hard for me to tip them! 

The inside is clean and relatively well maintained. They also have a few board games available to play (e.g. Trivial Pursuit, Jenga, Scrabble). We didn't order any food, but I saw another table's hummus and pita plate which looked pretty good. 

Overalll I don't think I would return as there are better places to visit in the area."	1	0	0	['wow', 'random', 'establish', 'came', 'friday', 'night', 'guy', 'play', 'blue', 'front', 'patio', 'back', 'patio', 'didnt', 'check', 'go', 'insid', 'serv', 'bar', 'server', 'pretti', 'clueless', 'ask', 'glass', 'chardonnay', 'guy', 'didnt', 'know', 'whether', 'didnt', 'even', 'check', 'bar', 'without', 'say', 'wine', 'fridg', 'right', 'behind', 'want', 'pay', 'glass', 'wine', 'visa', 'actual', 'probabl', 'took', 'around', 'minut', 'process', 'end', 'turn', 'cant', 'take', 'combin', 'visadebit', 'card', 'forewarn', 'end', 'pay', 'cash', 'paid', 'wine', 'friend', 'beer', 'gave', 'gave', 'bill', 'fair', 'enough', 'made', 'hard', 'tip', 'insid', 'clean', 'rel', 'well', 'maintain', 'also', 'board', 'game', 'avail', 'play', 'eg', 'trivial', 'pursuit', 'jenga', 'scrabbl', 'didnt', 'order', 'food', 'saw', 'anoth', 'tabl', 'hummu', 'pita', 'plate', 'look', 'pretti', 'good', 'overall', 'dont', 'think', 'would', 'return', 'better', 'place', 'visit', 'area']

I came here with one other friend for dinner around 6pm on a Tuesday evening. We know that Fresh can get busy and does not take reservations, so we decided to come earlier as opposed to later. When we arrived the restaurant was about 80% occupied and there were still a number of tables available. Despite this, the hostess said it would be a few minutes wait and she took our names. We were a bit confused because there were clearly empty tables available for parties of two. Nevertheless we were seated about a minute later.

This restaurant is jam packed. Don't come expecting any privacy at all. Our table was literally no more than four inches apart from the gentleman dining beside us. Every time I come to this location without fail someone at the table beside me (or myself) knocks something off of a neighbouring table when entering or exiting their seat.

Our server was pleasant and described the soups of the day for us and explained that they were out of the special of the day. I appreciated the she ensured we always had enough water at our table because I can find that they sometimes forget to do this at Fresh.

My friend and I both ordered our go to dishes. The macro greens on steamed greens (no sprouts, extra sweet potato) with chickpeas on the side for me and the baby beach bowel on rice with a side of corn bread and hummus for my friend. These dishes were both received as expected and we were pleased. I also asked  for their hot sauce because I love spicy food. Usually I love the hot sauce at Fresh, but this time it was a bit disappointing. It was not as spicy as usual and I had to cover my dish in it to get any sort of kick. I went through about 3\/4 of the pot!

Overall the meal was generally as expected and we left satisfied."	1	0	0	['fresh', 'mani', 'occas', 'third', 'time', 'specif', 'locat', 'review', 'base', 'specif', 'visiti', 'came', 'one', 'friend', 'dinner', 'around', 'pm', 'tuesday', 'even', 'know', 'fresh', 'get', 'busi', 'take', 'reserv', 'decid', 'come', 'earlier', 'oppos', 'later', 'arriv', 'restaur', 'occupi', 'still', 'number', 'tabl', 'avail', 'despit', 'hostess', 'said', 'would', 'minut', 'wait', 'took', 'name', 'bit', 'confus', 'clearli', 'empti', 'tabl', 'avail', 'parti', 'two', 'nevertheless', 'seat', 'minut', 'laterthi', 'restaur', 'jam', 'pack', 'dont', 'come', 'expect', 'privaci', 'tabl', 'liter', 'four', 'inch', 'apart', 'gentleman', 'dine', 'besid', 'us', 'everi', 'time', 'come', 'locat', 'without', 'fail', 'someon', 'tabl', 'besid', 'knock', 'someth', 'neighbour', 'tabl', 'enter', 'exit', 'seatour', 'server', 'pleasant', 'describ', 'soup', 'day', 'us', 'explain', 'special', 'day', 'appreci', 'ensur', 'alway', 'enough', 'water', 'tabl', 'find', 'sometim', 'forget', 'freshmi', 'friend', 'order', 'go', 'dish', 'macro', 'green', 'steam', 'green', 'sprout', 'extra', 'sweet', 'potato', 'chickpea', 'side', 'babi', 'beach', 'bowel', 'rice', 'side', 'corn', 'bread', 'hummu', 'friend', 'dish', 'receiv', 'expect', 'pleas', 'also', 'ask', 'hot', 'sauc', 'love', 'spici', 'food', 'usual', 'love', 'hot', 'sauc', 'fresh', 'time', 'bit', 'disappoint', 'spici', 'usual', 'cover', 'dish', 'get', 'sort', 'kick', 'went', 'potoveral', 'meal', 'gener', 'expect', 'left', 'satisfi']

The store is very large with a wide array of offerings. It is a good place to go to if you are looking for various ethnic foods or sauces. One of the best deals they have (which appears to be a standing deal) is a whole cooked BBQ chicken (halal - if that is a consideration for you) for $6.97. 

The service is not always consistent. Sometimes the staff are incredibly helpful and will take you directly to an item that you ask for, and sometimes they just grumble the aisle number to you in an unhappy manner. Despite this, I find that the cashiers are always quite pleasant."	2	0	0	['shop', 'occas', 'quit', 'satisfiedth', 'store', 'larg', 'wide', 'array', 'offer', 'good', 'place', 'go', 'look', 'variou', 'ethnic', 'food', 'sauc', 'one', 'best', 'deal', 'appear', 'stand', 'deal', 'whole', 'cook', 'bbq', 'chicken', 'halal', 'consider', 'servic', 'alway', 'consist', 'sometim', 'staff', 'incred', 'help', 'take', 'directli', 'item', 'ask', 'sometim', 'grumbl', 'aisl', 'number', 'unhappi', 'manner', 'despit', 'find', 'cashier', 'alway', 'quit', 'pleasant']

It's a small venue with only about a handful of table. Certainly not an ideal place for groups, and better suited to tables of 2-4 diners. They have a partially open kitchen so the four seats at the bar overlook the chefs. As a result, or possibly due to the building itself, the ventilation is very poor here causing the room to be really warm - to the point that they had to open to front door to cool things down. This meant that we had to fluctuate between asking for the door to be opened and closed throughout our meal.

The servers are definitely still learning the menu \/ the lay of the restaurant. I started as the first person to make my order and after I ordered two dishes, the server stopped me to describe what an appropriate amount of food was for our table for four and what she would suggest. Really, this should have happened when we were all initially seated and before we started to peruse the menu. The first dish I ordered was from the ""small"" section and it was a plate of cinnamon roasted beets with preserved lemon. When I asked for it, she remarked the the dish was a lot of beets! Our table laughed when we received the plate because in actuality it was quite small and it would be easy enough for someone to eat on their own. You could really taste the cinnamon and I did not detect the preserved lemon. Also, although not described on the menu, it comes on top of a layer of yogurt \/ cream - just in case you don't eat dairy (I don't). Another dish we ordered was the eggplant dip. I didn't particularly like it. It was more like a macerated bruschetta with bits of eggplant too (the tomato flavour came out more though) and a Seasoning that I did not particularly like. For $10, it was a tiny portion which I thought was overpriced. 

Originally, we ordered two tagines, two of the ""small"" dishes, and three of the ""sides"" (steamed carrot salad with raisins, couscous, and horchata - a fried buttery biscuit). This was way too much food and we canceled the second tagine after we could barely finish the first. 

While the food was interesting, I don't think I would rush back anytime soon, because it wasn't the type of food that blew me away and left me craving it over and over again."	3	0	0	['restaur', 'open', 'four', 'day', 'ago', 'tell', 'still', 'work', 'kink', 'small', 'venu', 'hand', 'tabl', 'certainli', 'ideal', 'place', 'group', 'better', 'suit', 'tabl', 'diner', 'partial', 'open', 'kitchen', 'four', 'seat', 'bar', 'overlook', 'chef', 'result', 'possibl', 'due', 'build', 'ventil', 'poor', 'caus', 'room', 'realli', 'warm', 'point', 'open', 'front', 'door', 'cool', 'thing', 'meant', 'fluctuat', 'ask', 'door', 'open', 'close', 'throughout', 'mealth', 'server', 'definit', 'still', 'learn', 'menu', 'lay', 'restaur', 'start', 'first', 'person', 'make', 'order', 'order', 'two', 'dish', 'server', 'stop', 'describ', 'appropri', 'amount', 'food', 'tabl', 'four', 'would', 'suggest', 'realli', 'happen', 'initi', 'seat', 'start', 'perus', 'menu', 'first', 'dish', 'order', 'small', 'section', 'plate', 'cinnamon', 'roast', 'beet', 'preserv', 'lemon', 'ask', 'remark', 'dish', 'lot', 'beet', 'tabl', 'laugh', 'receiv', 'plate', 'actual', 'quit', 'small', 'would', 'easi', 'enough', 'someon', 'eat', 'could', 'realli', 'tast', 'cinnamon', 'detect', 'preserv', 'lemon', 'also', 'although', 'describ', 'menu', 'come', 'top', 'layer', 'yogurt', 'cream', 'case', 'dont', 'eat', 'dairi', 'dont', 'anoth', 'dish', 'order', 'eggplant', 'dip', 'didnt', 'particularli', 'like', 'like', 'macer', 'bruschetta', 'bit', 'eggplant', 'tomato', 'flavour', 'came', 'though', 'season', 'particularli', 'like', 'tini', 'portion', 'thought', 'overpr', 'origin', 'order', 'two', 'tagin', 'two', 'small', 'dish', 'three', 'side', 'steam', 'carrot', 'salad', 'raisin', 'couscou', 'horchata', 'fri', 'butteri', 'biscuit', 'way', 'much', 'food', 'cancel', 'second', 'tagin', 'could', 'bare', 'finish', 'first', 'food', 'interest', 'dont', 'think', 'would', 'rush', 'back', 'anytim', 'soon', 'wasnt', 'type', 'food', 'blew', 'away', 'left', 'crave']

They have an extensive brunch and breakfast menu with pretty well anything you could want.

I ordered the fruit bowl ($8). It is a decent sized dish that came with bananas, cantaloupe, grapes, berries (all types), kiwi, mango, and pineapple. Some of the pieces of pineapple had brown spots on them which didn't look too appetizer; however, all of the other fruit were fresh. I would order this dish again, although I think $8 is a bit steep - $6 would be more reasonable.

My friend ordered a standard two egg breakfast ($7.95) that came with home fries, bakes beans, and toast. They have dark rye bread! I love it when diners offer rye toast! He enjoyed his dish and thought it was pretty standard fare.

We had unlimited coffee and tea ($2.75 each), but I had to keep asking for refills of my pot of tea because they serve it in a tiny pot!

The environment is relaxed and casual. It looks like a diner from the 20s-40s, but it's clean and well maintained.

Service was fast and efficient and our food and drinks arrived quickly. Our server was very friendly, but it would have been helpful for her to tell us to take our cheque to the front to pay. 

I would definitely return for breakfast \/ brunch again or to try lunch or dinner there.

I did appreciate their food court area and I liked how the different warms foods were separated by ethnicity. I would have liked to have seen more prepared meals that you could take to go or warm up at home. For example, they did not have a lot of sushi available when I went. 

They have some good prices, but I would not say their deals are incredible or worth the drive if you're coming from downtown. The store is clean and bright and the service is friendly and helpful.

Expect nothing but great service, I would say around dinner time the price for two people is about $60, they offer stamp cards if you are frequent customer.

I been going to this place since it opened back in 2008ish. This is my go to place when it comes to sushi. They are super friendly and super fast service, I can't complain.

The gentleman helping us today was super nice and even let us know if we had questions, that he would be happy to help. The decor inside is simple, cute, and clean.

My love and I decided to make our own creations with the choice of snow, 3 toppings, and sauce. I ordered a ninja and he ordered a mini, which came out to about $10.

The snow is really fluffy compared to snowflake. While here it's more creamy and snow like, snowflake was a little harder and more like shaved ice\/ice cream. The toppings were great and looked really fresh. I ordered the milk tea flavor with strawberries, captain crunch, mochi, and condensed milk. The other order was cookie butter flavor with mochi, sprinkles, cheesecake pieces, and condensed milk. 

Compared to the two places i've tried, I would have to say they are both great. I think snowflake has more flavor in their snow compared to here, but kuma's is more lighter and airy. In the end, kuma is good to try but i'd opt for snowflake."	0	0	0	['date', 'time', 'tuesday', 'pmthe', 'gentleman', 'help', 'us', 'today', 'super', 'nice', 'even', 'let', 'us', 'know', 'question', 'would', 'happi', 'help', 'decor', 'insid', 'simpl', 'cute', 'cleanmi', 'love', 'decid', 'make', 'creation', 'choic', 'snow', 'top', 'sauc', 'order', 'ninja', 'order', 'mini', 'came', 'snow', 'realli', 'fluffi', 'compar', 'snowflak', 'creami', 'snow', 'like', 'snowflak', 'littl', 'harder', 'like', 'shave', 'iceic', 'cream', 'top', 'great', 'look', 'realli', 'fresh', 'order', 'milk', 'tea', 'flavor', 'strawberri', 'captain', 'crunch', 'mochi', 'condens', 'milk', 'order', 'cooki', 'butter', 'flavor', 'mochi', 'sprinkl', 'cheesecak', 'piec', 'condens', 'milk', 'compar', 'two', 'place', 'ive', 'tri', 'would', 'say', 'great', 'think', 'snowflak', 'flavor', 'snow', 'compar', 'kuma', 'lighter', 'airi', 'end', 'kuma', 'good', 'tri', 'id', 'opt', 'snowflak']

I never knew we had a farm in Las Vegas, but what sold me was the raw honey. As soon as we got there we paid our $5 entrance fee and took a look around. They have food you can buy to give to the animals (carrots and hay). The walk around the farm was fun, we got to see cows, chickens, pigs, and horses. I also bought 6 large jars of honey for $20 a pop.

This is definitely worth a trip. They also have fruits and vegetables for sale too."	5	0	1	['date', 'time', 'pmi', 'never', 'knew', 'farm', 'la', 'vega', 'sold', 'raw', 'honey', 'soon', 'got', 'paid', 'entranc', 'fee', 'took', 'look', 'around', 'food', 'buy', 'give', 'anim', 'carrot', 'hay', 'walk', 'around', 'farm', 'fun', 'got', 'see', 'cow', 'chicken', 'pig', 'hors', 'also', 'bought', 'larg', 'jar', 'honey', 'popthi', 'definit', 'worth', 'trip', 'also', 'fruit', 'veget', 'sale']

I came here after work with a few coworkers, expecting since it's still the weekend it would be pretty busy (said a co-worker who was raving about this place).

The wait was about 30 mins, then the line grew as we were waiting for our table. We ordered:
- Soyu Ramen (extra chasiu)
- 2 Tonkatsu Ramen (extra chasiu and egg)
- 1 Pork belly bowl
- 4 drinks
total is around $50

Since this was the first time trying a Ramen spot besides my own mothers, I decided why not, since one of my co-workers have been asking all of us to go everyday at work. We entered the restaurant after the wait and the table are really packed close together (so it's like we're eating the table next to us). The people in line are watching other people eat, it's kind of awkward.

I tried my ramen, it was good but not the greatest (I told him, the hype he was giving this restaurant was not necessary anymore). The chasiu was weird, it was disintegrating in my soup. It was mostly melty, fatty, and I found it pointless to get extra. 

My love got so sick from this place, he was perfectly fine, until that night. He was sweating and grabbing a fever, everything came out from both ends for a couple of days. He's afraid to try Ramen again :("	0	0	0	['date', 'time', 'sunday', 'pmi', 'came', 'work', 'cowork', 'expect', 'sinc', 'still', 'weekend', 'would', 'pretti', 'busi', 'said', 'cowork', 'rave', 'placeth', 'wait', 'min', 'line', 'grew', 'wait', 'tabl', 'order', 'soyu', 'ramen', 'extra', 'chasiu', 'tonkatsu', 'ramen', 'extra', 'chasiu', 'egg', 'pork', 'belli', 'bowl', 'drinkstot', 'around', 'sinc', 'first', 'time', 'tri', 'ramen', 'spot', 'besid', 'mother', 'decid', 'sinc', 'one', 'cowork', 'ask', 'us', 'go', 'everyday', 'work', 'enter', 'restaur', 'wait', 'tabl', 'realli', 'pack', 'close', 'togeth', 'like', 'eat', 'tabl', 'next', 'us', 'peopl', 'line', 'watch', 'peopl', 'eat', 'kind', 'awkwardi', 'tri', 'ramen', 'good', 'greatest', 'told', 'hype', 'give', 'restaur', 'necessari', 'anymor', 'chasiu', 'weird', 'disintegr', 'soup', 'mostli', 'melti', 'fatti', 'found', 'pointless', 'get', 'extra', 'love', 'got', 'sick', 'place', 'perfectli', 'fine', 'night', 'sweat', 'grab', 'fever', 'everyth', 'came', 'end', 'coupl', 'day', 'he', 'afraid', 'tri', 'ramen']

The best pizza place ever. I would consider myself a pizza connoisseur. If you want great pizza, great appetizers, and great drinks. Then this is your place.

They offer a to-go menu and since I work downtown, they have a convenient window outside to order pizza to go.

When I came here, my love and I ordered:
-Classic meatballs (I would come here, just to eat the meatballs)
-Fried Green Beans (their not deep fried, but fried in a frying pan)
- Downtown pizza (my love wanted something meaty)
- 2 drinks (Sangria, tastes refreshing)

Everything is fresh and delicious here.

Oh lee's sandwiches, how you made bomb bbq pork bahn mi's for me in the past. What did you do to me last night :( 

I usually go to lee's sandwiches off the the 215 and eastern, but since I was near the strip, I decided to stop to this one -_-"" I should have gotten pho instead.

I ordered 2 bbq pork bahn mi, a special combination bahn mi, and a lee's coffee. The cost is around $18. I asked the cashier what was in the special combination bahn mi and he had no clue, he was nice enough to ask someone to tell us what's inside there (head cheese, jabon, pate), well I never had any of those interesting meats (I did not like the after taste, I'll stick to bbq pork). My love and I decided to go with the usual but try something different as well. We both took a bite of the special combination (props for those who can handle this taste), with the bread scraping against my gums and ripping my skin off, I already knew my bahn mi was not  going to be good.

I usually expect my bread to my bite-able, but no. BBQ pork had a off putting taste to it. I don't know, I felt like I had food poisoning after an hour of eating this meal. I will attempt to eat at my usual spot and let you know how it goes, but as for lee's in china town.

I was really craving hotpot because Lu Gi's in california was a life changer.  I came across this place and decided to give this place a go. 

This place is all-you-can-eat, you get to choose two soup bases (we opt for regular and spicy), the meat, vegetables,  and other items we self serve in fridges, and a sauce station (you can build your own sauce for dipping). 

I came during lunch because after reading some of the reviews, I was doubting it would be as great. I was wrong, this place is really fucking good. I can just only imagine what they serve during dinner time. I created my own sauce (peanut sauce, soy sauce, hot chili oil, a squeeze of lemon,  and seseme oil) and had ponzo just by itself. It was so bomb. 

If you're not into the whole waiting for your meat to cook in boiling soup, then this isnt for you. Trust me, by the end of your meal the soup is so full of flavor when you wait to put your noodles in at the end, best noodles you'll ever have.

After reading tons of yelp reviews, I had to try this place out. I ordered a medium caramelizer and my babe ordered a medium caramelizer freeze. Both similar in taste just his had ice particles and mine was over ice.

I just have to say the staff is SUPER friendly. Their customer service is excellent ! The lady that helped us at the drive thru asked if this was our first time and excitedly we said yes. Her words of awsomeness ""Oh nice, well welcome! & if you try this and it doesn't taste good, let me know and we will find something that you like"". Thank you for that :) you are awesome and the coffee was amazing

anyways, I purchased a small (the smallest size the offered, cause I had just eaten at monta). They had cookie butter flavor (OMG ! life has been made at this point), and she told me I can select a topping and a sauce, so I opt for condensed milk (I believe) and mochi pieces. The cost was around $5

The buffet was for two people at the price of $83 and some change. There is such variety when first stepping into the buffet. There are sections into seafood, american, mexican, italian, chinese\/japanese, and dessert. They have charcuterie with a selection of cheeses as well as a salad section. They offer all you can drink beer and mimosas for $22 (each)

The buffet highlight for me was the fresh juices and dessert. The food was good, I rather settle for a buffet a boulder station for cheaper, than to go here again. The food here was a little bland and I didn't really enjoy most of it. They do have a tapas style going for some of the food selections so you can try most of the items they have to offer, but it was missing something -flavor. I decided to try this place out due to the numerous reviews on how great this place is, I would recommend it for you to try it at least once (the seafood was awesome).

I've wanted to try a new ramen place, since Monta is always packed and has wait times over 45mins. I found this place with the help of some yelpers. I decided I can't go wrong with a place that offers ramen and appetizers.

I ordered:
- Takoyaki
- Tonkatsu
- 1 Soyu Ramen (garlic chips and extra chasiu)
- 1 Tonkatsu Ramen (extra chasiu and corn)
- 3 Calpico drinks
- 1 Sprite
total about $40

Since i've only tried Monta and (my moms ramen), I'll be comparing the two (mom already wins). 

I LOVE takoyaki and this place makes it so good, it's crisp on the outside and nice and creamy on the inside. The tonkatsu made with a cabbage salad and the tonkatsu sauce on the side, which was cooked to perfection. The tonkatsu was thick and crispy on the outside with the tender juicy pork on the inside. It was delicious.

When the ramen arrived the noodles were perfect, the soup was super flavorful and didn't need to add additional salt or soy sauce to it. Compared to monta's chasiu, this one is meaty in the middle and melt in your mouth on the sides (which is how it's suppose to be). I didn't enjoy the chasiu at Monta because it was like eating boiled fat (it was slippery, melty, and gooey). 

If you want incredible ramen, come here. The waitress was super friendly and helpful. This small ramen restaurant should be deemed the best. The best thing is, it didn't make my love sick, he got so sick at Monta, he was scared to try Ramen again."	1	0	0	['date', 'time', 'wednesday', 'pmive', 'want', 'tri', 'new', 'ramen', 'place', 'sinc', 'monta', 'alway', 'pack', 'wait', 'time', 'min', 'found', 'place', 'help', 'yelper', 'decid', 'cant', 'go', 'wrong', 'place', 'offer', 'ramen', 'appetizersi', 'order', 'takoyaki', 'tonkatsu', 'soyu', 'ramen', 'garlic', 'chip', 'extra', 'chasiu', 'tonkatsu', 'ramen', 'extra', 'chasiu', 'corn', 'calpico', 'drink', 'spritetot', 'sinc', 'ive', 'tri', 'monta', 'mom', 'ramen', 'ill', 'compar', 'two', 'mom', 'alreadi', 'win', 'love', 'takoyaki', 'place', 'make', 'good', 'crisp', 'outsid', 'nice', 'creami', 'insid', 'tonkatsu', 'made', 'cabbag', 'salad', 'tonkatsu', 'sauc', 'side', 'cook', 'perfect', 'tonkatsu', 'thick', 'crispi', 'outsid', 'tender', 'juici', 'pork', 'insid', 'deliciouswhen', 'ramen', 'arriv', 'noodl', 'perfect', 'soup', 'super', 'flavor', 'didnt', 'need', 'add', 'addit', 'salt', 'soy', 'sauc', 'compar', 'monta', 'chasiu', 'one', 'meati', 'middl', 'melt', 'mouth', 'side', 'suppos', 'didnt', 'enjoy', 'chasiu', 'monta', 'like', 'eat', 'boil', 'fat', 'slipperi', 'melti', 'gooey', 'want', 'incred', 'ramen', 'come', 'waitress', 'super', 'friendli', 'help', 'small', 'ramen', 'restaur', 'deem', 'best', 'best', 'thing', 'didnt', 'make', 'love', 'sick', 'got', 'sick', 'monta', 'scare', 'tri', 'ramen']

After work I decided that I wanted to try something different. I didn't realize how far this location was, but in the end it was worth it. This shop is really cute with all the decor inside of it. 

We started off with the popcorn chicken, which is so amazing and delicious. The hotpot comes with pork rice -which is amazing !!!!! I could just eat the rice with the popcorn chicken. The hotpot comes with a sort of things inside of it. The hotpot looks small, but it is super filling (like so filling, I had to stretch out before headed back home). Our waitress was really adorable and super friendly, she told us you can keep the flame on or to ask her when to turn it off. I tried to keep mine on as long as possible, but that shit boils over and gets super hot ! 

Price:
2 hotpots (Ribeye and Taiwanese Spicy Pot)

I had a taco plate and it was okay. We stopped by for dinner before a show last weekend at The House of Blues- venue is just a hop down the escalator. Very convenient. I had a Blackberry Splash to drink- muddled blueberry, tequila, and ginger liqeuor- very refreshing.	0	0	0	['extra', 'star', 'given', 'mani', 'vegan', 'menu', 'option', 'vegan', 'companion', 'abl', 'order', 'vegan', 'chile', 'relleno', 'taco', 'plate', 'okay', 'stop', 'dinner', 'show', 'last', 'weekend', 'hous', 'blue', 'venu', 'hop', 'escal', 'conveni', 'blackberri', 'splash', 'drink', 'muddl', 'blueberri', 'tequila', 'ginger', 'liqeuor', 'refresh']

Étant parti en voyage....j'en avais entendu parler vaguement...mais sans plus...En étant dedans je me suis souvenue que c'était THE SPOT ben à la mode donc plusieurs parlent. 

Un mardi soir..c'était bondé ...tsé il y avait très peu ou pas de table vide qu'on pouvait voir à partir de la vitrine qui donne sur Ste-Catherine.  Mais bon vu que ça avait d'l'air cool..je suis rentré avec mon amie. Les 2 hôtesses me disent de laisser le manteau au vestiaire..qu'il n'y a pas de charge et tout. C'est ce que je fais. Je n'étais pas habillé pour sortir et 0 maquillage, bref je n'étais pas le client cible et sa paraissait.  Les 2 hôtesses me demandent si j'ai une réservation, je dis non, elles essaient de trouver une table...et je leur dit...Mais je veux juste prendre un verre. Alors une hôtesse nous dit..ah alors je vais vous amener au bar. 

Mais oui toi...je ne savais pas qu'il y avait un beergarden derrière avec des sofas, des plantes, des tables de pool, des petits plats et de l'alcool!   On demande un pichet de bière au bar. 18$ pour le pichet et plusieurs format...on a pris le plus gros. La serveuse super mais super sympathique.  Elle nous a demandé si c'était notre première fois ..nous a parlé du menu etc etc. La carte de mon amie avait un problème..j'ai donc dû aller chercher ma carte au vestiaire pour payer. La chère barmaid blonde aux cheveux long bouclé a été hyper compréhensible et zéro stress. 

Comme on avait déjà manger avant on avait pas faim, mais les plats sentaient hyper bon!! C'est sûre et certains que j'y retourne. J'aimerai ça y retourner plus tard en soirée..tse quand la musique forte commence et le monde est drunk et la piste de dance se forme..! Reste à voir si c'est vrai qu'ils sont si select le soir et autant rempli comme les autres avis le mentionne!"	8	0	0	['jai', 'l', 'pour', 'prendr', 'un', 'verr', 'apr', 'un', 'superb', 'vnement', 'yelp', 'tant', 'parti', 'en', 'voyagejen', 'avai', 'entendu', 'parler', 'vaguementmai', 'san', 'plusen', 'tant', 'dedan', 'je', 'sui', 'souvenu', 'que', 'ctait', 'spot', 'ben', 'la', 'mode', 'donc', 'plusieur', 'parlent', 'un', 'mardi', 'soirctait', 'bond', 'ts', 'il', 'avait', 'tr', 'peu', 'ou', 'pa', 'de', 'tabl', 'vide', 'quon', 'pouvait', 'voir', 'partir', 'de', 'la', 'vitrin', 'qui', 'donn', 'sur', 'stecatherin', 'mai', 'bon', 'vu', 'que', 'avait', 'dlair', 'coolj', 'sui', 'rentr', 'avec', 'mon', 'ami', 'le', 'htess', 'disent', 'de', 'laisser', 'le', 'manteau', 'au', 'vestiairequil', 'ny', 'pa', 'de', 'charg', 'et', 'tout', 'cest', 'ce', 'que', 'je', 'fai', 'je', 'ntai', 'pa', 'habil', 'pour', 'sortir', 'et', 'maquillag', 'bref', 'je', 'ntai', 'pa', 'le', 'client', 'cibl', 'et', 'sa', 'paraissait', 'le', 'htess', 'demand', 'si', 'jai', 'une', 'rservat', 'je', 'di', 'non', 'ell', 'essaient', 'de', 'trouver', 'une', 'tableet', 'je', 'leur', 'ditmai', 'je', 'veux', 'just', 'prendr', 'un', 'verr', 'alor', 'une', 'htess', 'nou', 'ditah', 'alor', 'je', 'vai', 'vou', 'amen', 'au', 'bar', 'mai', 'oui', 'toij', 'ne', 'savai', 'pa', 'quil', 'avait', 'un', 'beergarden', 'derrir', 'avec', 'de', 'sofa', 'de', 'plant', 'de', 'tabl', 'de', 'pool', 'de', 'petit', 'plat', 'et', 'de', 'lalcool', 'demand', 'un', 'pichet', 'de', 'bire', 'au', 'bar', 'pour', 'le', 'pichet', 'et', 'plusieur', 'formaton', 'pri', 'le', 'plu', 'gro', 'la', 'serveus', 'super', 'mai', 'super', 'sympathiqu', 'ell', 'nou', 'demand', 'si', 'ctait', 'notr', 'premir', 'foi', 'nou', 'parl', 'du', 'menu', 'etc', 'etc', 'la', 'cart', 'de', 'mon', 'ami', 'avait', 'un', 'problmejai', 'donc', 'aller', 'chercher', 'cart', 'au', 'vestiair', 'pour', 'payer', 'la', 'chre', 'barmaid', 'blond', 'aux', 'cheveux', 'long', 'boucl', 'hyper', 'comprhens', 'et', 'zro', 'stress', 'comm', 'avait', 'dj', 'manger', 'avant', 'avait', 'pa', 'faim', 'mai', 'le', 'plat', 'sentaient', 'hyper', 'bon', 'cest', 'sre', 'et', 'certain', 'que', 'jy', 'retourn', 'jaimerai', 'retourn', 'plu', 'tard', 'en', 'soirets', 'quand', 'la', 'musiqu', 'fort', 'commenc', 'et', 'le', 'mond', 'est', 'drunk', 'et', 'la', 'pist', 'de', 'danc', 'se', 'form', 'rest', 'voir', 'si', 'cest', 'vrai', 'quil', 'sont', 'si', 'select', 'le', 'soir', 'et', 'autant', 'rempli', 'comm', 'le', 'autr', 'avi', 'le', 'mentionn']

Peut-être n'ai-je pas commandé la spécialité? Bref, j'ai pris un Chow Mein aux fruit de mers (style Cantonais, avec des nouilles croustillantes). Certes, c'était bien mais je pouvais remarquer que les fruits de mer n'étaient pas frais, il y avait un arrière goût de congeler. 24$ avec taxes et tips. Pas mal plus cher qu'au Chinatown et moins bon. Bien-sûr nous sommes dans un resto plus chic que ceux du chinatown et c'est un apportez votre vin. J'ai goûter les plats de mes amis autour de moi. Le général thai délicieux! Si j'y retourne je vais choisir ce plat. J'ai goûté à une entrée avec de la viande cru c'était bon. Un calmar aussi délicieux. Mais le tartare, cela m'a étonné qu'un resto dit Bar à Sushi offre un tartare aussi fade. De plus, il était un peu chaud, pas chaud dans le sens cuit mais dans le sens plus chaud que température ambiante. Le restaurant ferme à 11h pile et le staff nous le fera comprendre assez vite. Par contre, le serveur et le staff super gentil et amical. Super endroit pour faire un souper d'anniversaire.	1	0	0	['samedi', 'soir', 'le', 'resto', 'est', 'completl', 'gen', 'de', 'lest', 'mavai', 'parl', 'beaucoup', 'de', 'ce', 'resto', 'quil', 'tait', 'super', 'bon', 'et', 'tout', 'mai', 'jai', 'du', 'peuttr', 'naij', 'pa', 'command', 'la', 'spcialit', 'bref', 'jai', 'pri', 'un', 'chow', 'mein', 'aux', 'fruit', 'de', 'mer', 'style', 'cantonai', 'avec', 'de', 'nouill', 'croustillant', 'cert', 'ctait', 'bien', 'mai', 'je', 'pouvai', 'remarqu', 'que', 'le', 'fruit', 'de', 'mer', 'ntaient', 'pa', 'frai', 'il', 'avait', 'un', 'arrir', 'got', 'de', 'congel', 'avec', 'tax', 'et', 'tip', 'pa', 'mal', 'plu', 'cher', 'quau', 'chinatown', 'et', 'moin', 'bon', 'biensr', 'nou', 'somm', 'dan', 'un', 'resto', 'plu', 'chic', 'que', 'ceux', 'du', 'chinatown', 'et', 'cest', 'un', 'apportez', 'votr', 'vin', 'jai', 'goter', 'le', 'plat', 'de', 'me', 'ami', 'autour', 'de', 'moi', 'le', 'gnral', 'thai', 'dlicieux', 'si', 'jy', 'retourn', 'je', 'vai', 'choisir', 'ce', 'plat', 'jai', 'got', 'une', 'entr', 'avec', 'de', 'la', 'viand', 'cru', 'ctait', 'bon', 'un', 'calmar', 'aussi', 'dlicieux', 'mai', 'le', 'tartar', 'cela', 'tonn', 'quun', 'resto', 'dit', 'bar', 'sushi', 'offr', 'un', 'tartar', 'aussi', 'fade', 'de', 'plu', 'il', 'tait', 'un', 'peu', 'chaud', 'pa', 'chaud', 'dan', 'le', 'sen', 'cuit', 'mai', 'dan', 'le', 'sen', 'plu', 'chaud', 'que', 'tempratur', 'ambiant', 'le', 'restaur', 'ferm', 'h', 'pile', 'et', 'le', 'staff', 'nou', 'le', 'fera', 'comprendr', 'assez', 'vite', 'par', 'contr', 'le', 'serveur', 'et', 'le', 'staff', 'super', 'gentil', 'et', 'amic', 'super', 'endroit', 'pour', 'fair', 'un', 'souper', 'danniversair']

Les filles sont aussi habillé avec un costume d'Octoberfest et on peut commander des MÉGA GIGA PICHET DE BIÈRE...pour une personne :o De ce que je me souviens ils avaient une belle sélection de bière et pas trop dispendieux. J'étais au bar, je parlais aux inconnus les inconnus me parlaient, et tournée de shooter pour tout le monde!! Bref, une clientèle super sociale. 

Côté musique, tu sais le genre de chanson que tout le monde connais et aime chanter fort quand tu as bu un peu trop, c'était ça :) Et très diversifié. Il y a un groupe de girl qui a commencé à danser une danse en ligne et je me suis jointe à eux...Bref, pas super ma danse, mais j'ai eu beaucoup de fun avec ses girls.

Nous sommes placé  dans un coin semi-privée, ce qui est bien. Par contre, nous avions une réservation à 19h30 et nous sommes sortie du resto vers minuit. Laissez-moi vous dire que l'attente était longue. Ok oui le temps que tout le monde arrive il etait peut être 8h 8h30...mais quand même. Il fallait être patient pour qu'on vienne ouvrir les bouteilles de vin. 

Pour votre info, c'est un apportez votre vin. J'ai vu quelques entrée qui a l'oeil avait l'air délicieuse, mais je n'y ai pas goûté. Moi qui est une GRANDE FAN de nouilles croustillantes avec poulet grillé et légumes ou fruit de mer, parfois appelé Chow mein cantonnais ou nid d'oisequ j'ai bien évidemment pris cela. Et c'était so so. Pas assez de nouilles, sans goût. Une chance qu'il y avait de la sauce Sriratcha. 

Mon ami a pris un Pad Thai, et c'est pour cette raison que le resto merite un 2*. Mon ami mangr tout, même quand ce n'est pas écoeurant. Tsé un gars pas diffile. Et bien il a détesté et avec raison. J'y ai goutté. Les nouilles étaient beaucoup trop cuite. On dirait que c'était un plat très normal et qu'ils ont mis de la sauce soya et des restants de légumes avec un peu de sirop de table pour que ça ressemble à un plat asiatique.

J'ai aussi pu goûté les sushis (les restants des gens de mon groupe hihihi) c'était correct. Belle présentation. Une fille qui avait commandé pleins de sushi m'a dit: tu mettras 2* à ton avis. Bref, d'après moi elle n'a pas trop aimé les sushis.

Finalement, le décor et très bien. Les cuisinier sont super sympathiques quand on passent devant eux.

Mes collègues étaient partant pour aller là...et ils étaient 2, alors ils ont gagné la place où il fallait aller dîner. Ils m'ont dit que les portions étaient grosses...j'étais comme oui...comme dans tous les restos grecques...blablabla..tsédodu comme je suis,  je m'en étais capable ERREUR. HEY C'EST UN RESTO POUR LES GENS QUI ONT FAIM!! omg!!! On a tous commander l'assietteS de Gyros....j'ai mis assiettes avec un ""S"", car c'était 2 assiettes et oui.....une moyenne pour le MÉGA GYRO et une hyper grosse avec le riz, salade (avec mega morceau de feta) pis des bonnes frites mmm... 

J'ai eu récemment une opération à la bouche....alors le gyro ne rentrait pas...et même si ma bouche avait été en parfaite santé...les bouchées auraient été difficile. La viande était ohhh que délicieuse...des parties tendres, juteuses, ""broils""...bref délicieux...le tout avec des tranches de tomates...oignon et sûrement de la laitue et le tout garni de sauce  tzatziki aussi gros que le sandwich en tant que tel... 

Je souhaite vraiment retourner un jour avec quelqu'un'un pour partager un plat à 2...car le plat est immense et essayer les calmars...!

Je ne met pas 5*, car malgré toutes les célébrités (genre BILL CLINTON OMGGG), et les nombreux merveilleux avis dans les médias...la place n'a pas d'l'air très propre. Par contre j'adore l'effet vieillot... La serveuse est vraiment sympathique et on reçoit un bonbon à la menthe à la fin YESSS Croyez-moi que ça aide beaucoup...car le goût de l'ail reste longtemps dans notre gorge!!!

En ecrivant ses lignes je suis présentement couché dans mon lit avec un mal de ventre, un goût de vomir et un goût de ce que j'ai mangé qui me donne encore plus mal au coeur. Coïncidence? Non je ne crois pas.

Alors, j'ai commandé là, car j'avais un craving de chinese food et je travaille à Laval (donc un peu loin pour aller au Chinatown). Alors je suis tombé sur ce resto grâce à Justeat.ca. J'ai été directement sur le site de Delice de chine. Sur leur site il y était indiqué qu'il y avait des spéciaux du midi. J'ai demandé un speciaux du midi et le monsieur (qui parlaient seulement anglais ou cantonnais) m'a dit que ça ne rentrait pas dans le minimum de livraison et que c'était une petite portion. Or, moi je n'avais pas déjeuner et j'avais beaucoup trop faim et je me suis dit qu'il m'en resterait pour le souper. 

ERREUR!! cela à pris plus d'une heure et demi à venir. C'était chaud et ils prennaient Interact! J'avais spécifié que je voulais de la Spicy sauce ou de la Srirasha. Hélas, il n'y en avait pas. Que deux sachet de sauce soya. Une chance que j'avais des ustensiles, car  il n'y en avait pas non plus dans le sac. 

Bref, j'ai commandé une Wonton. Beurk beurk beurk. Mes won ton sont meilleurs. Les wonton du buffet cheap du Chinatown sont meilleurs. Je crois qu'il n'y avait aucun bouillon ou le bouillon était beaucoup trop dillué. Évidemment, je ne l'ai pas fini. Je suis donc passé au repas principal. Un chow mein cantonais. J'ai même demandé au monsieur par téléphone si c'était avec des nouilles aux oeufs croustillantes. Normalement, il y a des légumes variés pis des nouilles croustillants. Les seuls légumes qu'il y avait c'était la sorte de laitue asiatique et des brocolis. Pour la viande, c'était des crevettes qui goutaient le congelée et du poulet qui goûtait le poulet bouilli... Et les nouille,ceux que j'ai reussi a trouver au fond, cacher par cette montagne de laitue, étaient blanches et molles. On dirait que c'était un restant que quelques chose, ils ont laver les nouilles et les ont mis dans mon plat.

Bref, plus jamais de delices pour moi.

Bon bien sûre...la vie dans la loge c'est bien...l'alcool est fournie, il y a des sofas..une belle vue etc etc. Dans la zone desjardins, quand c""est un soir de match, la bouffe est inclus et les soft drink. Profitez-en car le prix que le billet coûte et la nourriture d'habitude, il faut en profiter. 

Malheureusement, depuis 2 ans, il est interdit de sortir dehors dans n'importe quel évènement. Aussi, il est interdit de rentrer avec un Sac à dos. Alors...ne vous faites pas prendre par surprise.

Ouvert de 11h à 15h du lundi au vendredi pas plus. Too bad pour les gens normaux qui ont des horaires du lundi au vendredi et qui ne sont pas dans le coins. 

Bref, c'est un petit menu. Mais un bon petit menu. Il y a des dumplings, des petites salades un menu du jour, des désert et des entrées. J'ai été plate, je me suis pris des rouleaux impériaux et des dumplings de porc avec des trucs dedans qui étaient DÉLICIEUX. Les rouleaux, j'en ai mangé des meilleurs, mais on voyait la fraîcheur du rouleau (tse pas ceux que tu ne sais pas trop ce qu'il y a dedans). Bref, on peut demander les dumplings bouilli ou poêlé. Tout ce qu'il y a un peu d'huile à meilleur goût alors j'ai bien sûre pris le poêlé. Le plat vient en paquet de 12 et tu peux choisir la sauce. Attention, tu as le droit qu'a une sauce, une différente en extra c'est un gros 50 sous que j'ai bien sûre payé. hihihi

J'ai adoré le local. Je ne peux pas vous dire si c'est parce que c'était une belle journée ensoleillé qu'on attendait depuis longtemps, mais un local blanc simple c'est beau. Il y a une petite cage toute belle à l'entrée. 

Ne faites pas la même erreur que moi en y allant seule. Il faut y aller à deux ou plus pour pouvoir choisir plusieurs plats! Vous pouvez aussi appeler pour reserver une table ou pour un take out. (On m'a dit qu'il y avait souvent des line up pour rentrer.

Une belle carte de drink..sauf pour la bière très basic. super service :) la clientèle est sympa. J'y retourne très bientôt pour goûter la nourriture!! :)""

Maintenant voici mon avis en 2017. Je me souvenais qu'ils n'y avais pas beaucoup de bière dans leur menu. Mais bon je voulais y aller pour essayer leur menu. La serveuse m'a donné la carte des bières de microbrasserie, et wow, je retire mes mots. Car du choix il y en a. On a du choix, pour des bière en fût, en canette et en bouteille. Super belle sélection de bières du Québec et importés. 

Le menu est aussi très diversifié quand même. Nous avons pris comme entrée, un plat où on retrouve des bouchées de morues panés, crevettes, calmars, piments, et je crois que c'est tout. Très délicieux avec la sauce tartare.  J'ai mangé un tartare de boeuf et mon ami le fish and chip. Le tartare de boeuf était bien, par contre les frites étaient froides et  très peu de vinaigrette sur la salade, comme s'ils avait oublié de mettre de l'huile et que du citron dessus, mais très peu. Donc, un peu plate sur ce côté. J'aurai aimé avoir du ketchup avec mes frites, mais la serveuse ne venait pas, et je ne trippais pas trop sur la mayo maison.

J'ai bien aimé l'ambiance, il y avait beaucoup de monde. Par contre, le bourdonnement des gens était entendu et on entendait pas la musique. La serveuse était très amicale et serviable. Malheureusement, je crois qu'ils étaient short staff. Nous avons reçu l'entrée quand même assez vite. Par contre, les plats principaux ont été très long à recevoir. J'ai eu le temps de boire deux grosses pintes et être un peu pompette dû au ventre vide :(. Mais sinon j'y retournerai!

Nous etions dans une salle de + ou -100 personnes au premier étage. L'immense salle à côté de nous avait au moins 1200 personnes. Dans la salle où j'étais, nous fetions un mariaga marocain. Nous avons eu des petites bouchées qui étaient excellente l'une aux autres. Le buffet préparé par le complexe aussi était excellente. Je ne sais pas qui a fait la déco, mais elle etait joli aussi. Le hall d'entrée est immense et parfait pour commencer la soirée avec cocktail. 

Quand on rentre, des hotesses sont là pour nous guider. Attention, le parking ce fait rare. Le vestiaire est aussi en haut et on nous donne un sac pour mettre nos bottes YEAH!

Dernière fois, j'ai été quand il allait fermé donc je n'ai pris que 2 plats...Bref, cette fois-ci j'ai pu savouver comme il faut. J'ai pris trois entrées différentes, Samosas, oignons frit et les crevettes Pakora. Toutes les trois délicieuse. J'ai pris un Thali comme plat pricipal. Si vous voulez goûter à un peu de tout je vous le conseille. 7$ pour un Thali en souper et cela inclut le pain Naan, du riz blanc, un morceau de poulet Tandori, des legumes cuits et un morceau de tomate et concombre et un super bon poulet au beurre. Super repas pour moins de 15$ chacun :) (Nous étions 2) Je suis habitué à aller au Punjab Palace, mais je crois que je vais allet plus souvent là. Il y a beaucoup moins de monde (dans le sens que c'est intime), c'est un peu moins cher et  c'est délicieux et surtout le service est meilleur :)

Bref, aucun jugement senti par le doorman. Une sécurité à l'intérieur m'a montré gentillement où laisser mon manteau. La musique et l'ambiance était au top!

Les prix sont très correct pour le vieux-port, nous avons pris 2 bouteilles de 40 oz je crois que nous avons laissé au bar. La barmaid qui nous a servie, une vrai pro! Elle s'est présenté, nous servais à chaque fois qu'elle nous voyait et qu'elle était dispo. Bref, très attentive aux clients. Son nom était Jessica! Merci gurl, nous t'avons bien aimé!

 Malgré que je ne sors plus trop trop, tsé avoir un travail de professionnel et la vieillesse n'aide pas trop, un nouveau critère est maintenant pour moi très important lors de mes sorties et ce sont les toilettes...surtout dans un endroit où on risque de boire pas mal....2 toilettes pour femmes, je ne juge que ce n'est pas assez. En plus, une barmaid l'a fait comprendre au clientes. Selon ses dires, son nom était Yasmine, une blonde avec une coupe style Bob. Nous étions 4-5 clientes à attendre pour faire un pipi pompette, elle est rentré dans les toilettes et a dit: 《Je travaille ici je travaille ici, JE DOIS PISSER》 Et sans même avoir le temps que les clientes et moi réagissent elle a dépassé tout le monde et est rentré dans la toilette qui s'est libéré. De la grosse classe et professionalisme. Je lui ai donc demandé son nom...c'est YASMINE.

J'ai failli mettre 3* suite à mon aventure aux toilettes, mais bon c'est un endroit que je recommande pour faire le PARTY!"	2	5	4	['mavait', 'souvent', 'parl', 'du', 'confession', 'comm', 'une', 'bonn', 'place', 'pour', 'passer', 'se', 'soir', 'fair', 'le', 'parti', 'comm', 'oli', 'primeau', 'du', 'beach', 'clubbref', 'jai', 'l', 'pour', 'un', 'anniversair', 'je', 'nai', 'pa', 'eu', 'de', 'jugement', 'dan', 'lentr', 'car', 'je', 'ne', 'sui', 'pa', 'ts', 'habil', 'ben', 'sexi', 'et', 'anyway', 'je', 'sui', 'dodu', 'alor', 'naurait', 'pa', 'ben', 'beau', 'bref', 'aucun', 'jugement', 'senti', 'par', 'le', 'doorman', 'une', 'scurit', 'lintrieur', 'montr', 'gentil', 'laisser', 'mon', 'manteau', 'la', 'musiqu', 'et', 'lambianc', 'tait', 'au', 'topl', 'prix', 'sont', 'tr', 'correct', 'pour', 'le', 'vieuxport', 'nou', 'avon', 'pri', 'bouteil', 'de', 'oz', 'je', 'croi', 'que', 'nou', 'avon', 'laiss', 'au', 'bar', 'la', 'barmaid', 'qui', 'nou', 'servi', 'une', 'vrai', 'pro', 'ell', 'sest', 'prsent', 'nou', 'servai', 'chaqu', 'foi', 'quell', 'nou', 'voyait', 'et', 'quell', 'tait', 'dispo', 'bref', 'tr', 'attent', 'aux', 'client', 'son', 'nom', 'tait', 'jessica', 'merci', 'gurl', 'nou', 'tavon', 'bien', 'aim', 'malgr', 'que', 'je', 'ne', 'sor', 'plu', 'trop', 'trop', 'ts', 'avoir', 'un', 'travail', 'de', 'professionnel', 'et', 'la', 'vieilless', 'naid', 'pa', 'trop', 'un', 'nouveau', 'critr', 'est', 'mainten', 'pour', 'moi', 'tr', 'import', 'lor', 'de', 'me', 'sorti', 'et', 'ce', 'sont', 'le', 'toilettessurtout', 'dan', 'un', 'endroit', 'risqu', 'de', 'boir', 'pa', 'mal', 'toilett', 'pour', 'femm', 'je', 'ne', 'juge', 'que', 'ce', 'nest', 'pa', 'assez', 'en', 'plu', 'une', 'barmaid', 'la', 'fait', 'comprendr', 'au', 'client', 'selon', 'se', 'dire', 'son', 'nom', 'tait', 'yasmin', 'une', 'blond', 'avec', 'une', 'coup', 'style', 'bob', 'nou', 'tion', 'client', 'attendr', 'pour', 'fair', 'un', 'pipi', 'pompett', 'ell', 'est', 'rentr', 'dan', 'le', 'toilett', 'et', 'dit', 'je', 'travail', 'ici', 'je', 'travail', 'ici', 'je', 'doi', 'pisser', 'et', 'san', 'mme', 'avoir', 'le', 'temp', 'que', 'le', 'client', 'et', 'moi', 'ragiss', 'ell', 'dpass', 'tout', 'le', 'mond', 'et', 'est', 'rentr', 'dan', 'la', 'toilett', 'qui', 'sest', 'libr', 'de', 'la', 'gross', 'class', 'et', 'professionalism', 'je', 'lui', 'ai', 'donc', 'demand', 'son', 'nomcest', 'yasminejai', 'failli', 'mettr', 'suit', 'mon', 'aventur', 'aux', 'toilett', 'mai', 'bon', 'cest', 'un', 'endroit', 'que', 'je', 'recommand', 'pour', 'fair', 'le', 'parti']

Une fille nous accoste pour nous dire de rentrer au Kyozon GRATUIT...et nous donne une carte et elles nous dit qu'on a un Free drink..yeah...

Mmm...pour être honnête on se cherchait une place vite fait pour faire pipi et prendre deux shots de Tequila donc on est rentré.. Bref...

Alors on rentre...le décor est super un peu vide pour le samedi du grand prix... Surtout que le show est fini sur Crescent...Après les toilettes on descends et on attends au bar pour du Tequila (qu'on s'avait très bien qu'on allait payer et qu'il n'allait pas être inclus dans le FREE DRINK de la promoteuse sur la rue...) et on attends......et on attends...et 15 minutes passent et on est partie...la fille à la porte nous à dit que c'était gratuit l'entrée(donc pas besoin de promoteuse pour rentrer..c'est NO COVER)...

Alors, on est aller rejoindre d'autres amis et une heure plus tard on repasse devant le Kyozon...Une autre fille nous dit Drink 2 for 1 drink 2 for 1... Et on lui explique qu'on a attendu une vingtaine de minute...elle nous dit que c'est bon il y a moins de monde et nous donne une place au bar...HAHAHAHA SURPRISE...20 MINUTES et rien...les barmaids qu'on a fait signe nous ont dit qu'elles servaient les commandes des serveurs...mais bon..avait-il une place caché? Car je ne sais pas trop où allait les verres.....Il y avait comme 4 bossboys...bref...personne pour nous servir :(

Même si je suis arriver 40 minutes avant la fermeture pour y boire un thé dans une journée glaciale, la serveuse m'a très bien accueilli. La carte des thé est très bien expliqué. Je suis tombé sous le charme des petits paragraphe expliquant d'où venait le thé, quel était le monsieur qui le confectionnait, quels types de feuilles étaient utilisé etc etc. J'ai trouvé la carte des sucreries un peu plate. Pas beaucoup de choix et les deux trucs que je voulais manger avec mon ami, il n'y en avait pas. On s'entend qu'on est arrivé 40 minutes avant la fermeture, c'est normal. Bref, c'est sûre et certain que je vais retourner à cet endroit pour lire, date, jaser, ou simplement boire un thé en regardant les gens alentours de moi.	0	0	0	['quel', 'joli', 'petit', 'endroit', 'rconfort', 'calm', 'et', 'chaleureux', 'mme', 'si', 'je', 'sui', 'arriv', 'minut', 'avant', 'la', 'fermetur', 'pour', 'boir', 'un', 'th', 'dan', 'une', 'journ', 'glacial', 'la', 'serveus', 'tr', 'bien', 'accueilli', 'la', 'cart', 'de', 'th', 'est', 'tr', 'bien', 'expliqu', 'je', 'sui', 'tomb', 'sou', 'le', 'charm', 'de', 'petit', 'paragraph', 'expliqu', 'venait', 'le', 'th', 'quel', 'tait', 'le', 'monsieur', 'qui', 'le', 'confectionnait', 'quel', 'type', 'de', 'feuill', 'taient', 'utili', 'etc', 'etc', 'jai', 'trouv', 'la', 'cart', 'de', 'sucreri', 'un', 'peu', 'plate', 'pa', 'beaucoup', 'de', 'choix', 'et', 'le', 'deux', 'truc', 'que', 'je', 'voulai', 'manger', 'avec', 'mon', 'ami', 'il', 'ny', 'en', 'avait', 'pa', 'sentend', 'quon', 'est', 'arriv', 'minut', 'avant', 'la', 'fermetur', 'cest', 'normal', 'bref', 'cest', 'sre', 'et', 'certain', 'que', 'je', 'vai', 'retourn', 'cet', 'endroit', 'pour', 'lire', 'date', 'jaser', 'ou', 'simplement', 'boir', 'un', 'th', 'en', 'regard', 'le', 'gen', 'alentour', 'de', 'moi']

J'y ai été cette fois-ci vers minuit et pas grand choix de Pizza et la pizza n'avait pas un air frais...Quand il est 3h la pizzeria est full. Pleins de délicieuses saveurs et c'est frais et bon...(est-ce que c'est à cause de l'alcool...sûrement) Bref, ca fait bien la job quand on a faim des pointes jumbos. Je vous conseille de ne pas aller aux toilettes situés au sous-sol. Ça sent bizarre, c'est sale et on ne sait pas trop ce qui s'est passé dans ses toilettes là fréquenté par toute sorte de personne sur la rue St-Laurent....Bref, bon petit spot pour de la pizza arter club et c'est ouvert tard.

J'y suis aller un vendredi midi, donc j'ai pu profité du menu midi! Un endroit où nous avons le choix autre qu'une soupe ou salade ça fait du bien. J'ai donc pris une entrée (je ne me souviens pas du nom désolé) avec des oignons caramélisés, du fromage et de la mortadella servie sur du pain. Succulent! Et j'ai pris les côtelettes d'agneaux..yummy! Le menu midi varie entre 18$ à 25$. J'ai bien mangé, par contre un peu deçu que le café ne soit pas inclus. Je vais certainement y retourner le soir, car le menu est très abordable. Et bien sûre essayer leur 5@7.

Pourquoi cette place ne mérite pas une autre étoile...Désolé si je me trompe mais avec un nom de resto commencant par Brasserie, je m'attendais à voir des bières autres que de la Heinekein, Laurentides, Saporo...bref vous voyez le genre. Seulement 2 choix en bouteilles... Par contre, une bonne variété de vino! 

Bref, je vous le conseille et essayez de prendre une table près de la fenêtre pour avoir une belle vue des nouvelles construction et du centre-ville!

Bon maintenant que tout est clarifié, je vais vous faire mon reviews par rapport au lieu et à la nourriture  et non aux danseuses..car même  si tout être humain  est beau...j'aime les garçons .  

Le menu(style table d'hôte: soupe ou salade et un désert)  change à chaque jour! Il est de 11h à 21h. Il y a un spécial sur un verre de bière à 3$ entre 11h et 14h (on aime ça!).  Le menu est quand même  très variés (la journée  où  j'ai été). Et il y a un plat qui se nomme "" En cas que..""... En cas que je ne sais pas pourquoi...mais bref cette journée là c'était  des quesadillas au steak avec crème  sûre  et salsa on the side. J'ai pris la salade comme entrée. Une salade très abondante avec sûrement  de la sauce Style italienne de kraft...mais étonnamment  bonne.  Les quesadillas...wow!! Je ne sais pas quel type il a pris son steak mais c'était tendre!! Il était en plus saignant. Les quarts de quesadilla étaient très garni  et les frites  wow délicieuses. Et en passant la porte de la cuisine était ouverte  quand on est rentré..et le tout à d'l'air très propre! Comme désert, il y avait un gâteau  très  simple à la vanille, mais délicieux avec du nutella fondu sur le dessus...moi qui n'aime pas le sucré!! Attention je vous dévoile le prix de ses trois services. ......RRRRRRROULEMENT DE TAMBOURS!!! UN GROS 10.75$ tseeee..non mais à ce prix là j'aimerai  y aller tous les jours...mais je garde ma dignité..ça reste  quand même  un bar de danseuses et je ne suis pas la clientèle  cible. Ah btw, il y a un menu fast food...avec hamburger..pogo.. poutine...ailes de poulet...etc....etc qui reste  là tous les jours.

Bon après  vous avoir commenté de nourriture, parlons de l'endroit! Je suis rentré  avec mon ami (qui en passant a été quand même  souvent en soirée, mais qu'il n'a jamais mangé là). Il y avait le doorman, le monsieur  a demandé  un prix d'entrée\/pourboire à notre discrétion...Je lui ai donné 10$...et mon ami m'a ensuite dit...normalement tu donne 2$ en plus il nous à même  pas amener  à notre table etc etc...bref...je vais le savoir la prochaine fois!

L'endroit est sombre  pour me midi...mais on s'entend ça reste un club de danseuses. Il doit y avoir beaucoup  plus d'ambiance durant le soir ça c'est sûre ! Les danseuses étaient ok...selon moi un peu plate ...mais bon  c'est  le midi....Mais elles  étaient belles!

Attention, chaque invitation donne le droit à y retourner 2 fois et y aller avec une autre personne. De plus, vous ne pouvez pas dépenser plus que 600$ et il y a une certaine quantité de produit à respecter. 

Bref, autrefois la vente accueillait beaucoup moins de gens et les prix valaient vraiment la peine. Maintenant, c'est un peu plus dispendieux...les prix sont bon mais pas toujours des 50-60%. À part les vernis Essi à 2$ OMG!!

Je suis arrivé à 11h45. Aucun menu n'est affiché. Juste une madame à côté de la caisse qui m'explique le concept. Il y a plusieurs sortes de pâtes et des à côté. 13.95$ pour pâtes avec 2 à côté. Les choix sont variables. 9$ et qqchose pour un plat de pâtes seulement! 

Alors en ne sachant pas quoi prendre dans les à côté...j'ai vu l'AMOUR...TORTELINNI SALSA ROSA!! (sauce rosée) mmmm Mes pâtes favorites...Alors j'ai demandé une assiette de ça....UNE MÉGA ASSIETTE GENRE...la fille après moi...à dit la même chose en demi-plat..Alors la demi-portion existe. Il y a aussi une vitrine avec des salades. J'ai pris la  salade aux légumes grillés....MÉGA BONNE COMBINAISON!! Bref un gros 13.95$ Mais sérieusement ohhh que délicieux.
 Il y a un self service d'eau avec un garçon trisomique qui s'occupe de remplir les pichets d'eau. Je fais cette remarque, car je crois que c'est la première fois que je vois une personne handicapé travailler devant la clientèle dans un resto...ET CHAPEAU AU RESTO :) Allez y tôt ça se rempli très vite...quand nous sommes partie, la moitié du menu derrière le comptoir avait déjà changer!!!

Oui le service est un peu lent, Oui il est préfèrable de ré server votre table si vous ne voulez pas attendre dans le line up. Oui la cuisine ferme à 11h30-minuit. Oui il faut attendre longtemps pour une table de pool  mais bon...

Je suis arrivé très très en retard (de 1h) ainsi que mes invités. On avait réservé une section avec une grosse table et sofa. On n'est jamais venu me faire des problèmes , car ça a pris une heure de plus pour remplir la table. Mes invités devaient donner mon nom en bas pour éviter le line up :) Nicee.

Le staff super gentil, même les bouncers :) il n'y avait pas de carte de drink, mais la serveuse avait beaucoup de connaissances pour nous proposer quelque chose. Même si le service était super lent..elle s'excusait tout le temps..et nous on aurait juste pu lever nos fesses pour aller au bar et se faire servir vite :p

La musique est bien, très diversifier. Cette soirée là il y avait un match de UFC et ils l'ont donnée :D yes

Leur menu est très variées comparativement à certaines années où le menu était écrit sur le  napperon en papier. 

Les plats y sont très bon. J'ai goûté leur tartare et leur ceviche. Délicieux les deux. Par contre le ceviche est un peu trop citroné et le goût des poivrons y prends le dessus. 

Ils ont des cocktails, bières et sangria. Leur pichet de sangria est environs de 30$. Je ne vous recommande pas l'endroit pour aller Boire seulement..!"	1	1	0	['un', 'e', 'avi', 'pour', 'le', 'jardin', 'nelson', 'un', 'incontourn', 'de', 'lt', 'montral', 'leur', 'terrass', 'est', 'magnifiqu', 'tou', 'le', 'soir', 'un', 'band', 'joue', 'du', 'jazz', 'entend', 'le', 'chant', 'de', 'petit', 'oiseaux', 'tout', 'autour', 'leur', 'menu', 'est', 'tr', 'vari', 'comparativ', 'certain', 'ann', 'le', 'menu', 'tait', 'crit', 'sur', 'le', 'napperon', 'en', 'papier', 'le', 'plat', 'sont', 'tr', 'bon', 'jai', 'got', 'leur', 'tartar', 'et', 'leur', 'cevich', 'dlicieux', 'le', 'deux', 'par', 'contr', 'le', 'cevich', 'est', 'un', 'peu', 'trop', 'citron', 'et', 'le', 'got', 'de', 'poivron', 'prend', 'le', 'dessu', 'il', 'ont', 'de', 'cocktail', 'bire', 'et', 'sangria', 'leur', 'pichet', 'de', 'sangria', 'est', 'environ', 'de', 'je', 'ne', 'vou', 'recommand', 'pa', 'lendroit', 'pour', 'aller', 'boir', 'seulement']

Mercredi soir au début décembre 19h30. La grosse pancarte sur la 40 qui annonçait le spécial 2 pour 22 avait attiré mon attention. Alors, cherchant une place pas cher pour manger, nous avons décidé d'aller là-bas...ERREUR. Premièrement, je sais que ce n'est pas la faute au resto mais il est quand même difficile de trouver l'endroit en auto. Ce n'est pas trop bien expliqué. 
Bref, nous rentrons là, le resto à quelques clients...genre une quinzaine. L'hôte hyper amicale nous a placer sur une banquette. Alors, je regarde le menu de pauvre, 2 pour 22, et bien il n'était pas trop attrayant.

 Et il y avait les autres plats....les fruits de mer avec pâtes m'attrayait. Et mon amie a décidé de me suivre, mais avec la table d'hôte. Elle a pris un tartare au saumon et moi les pâtes aux fruits de mer. Le serveur a amené la soupe de mon amie. Quelques minutes plus tard, le serveur est venu me demandé si c'est bel et bien les pâtes avec fruits de mer et non celui de crevettes, pétoncles et champignon. Je reconfirme mon plat de fruits de mer. En attendant nos plats, on a demandé du pain...c'était des petites baguettes...dûr au bout, mais chaude et moelleuse au milieu. Alors on reçoit nos plats. La lumière est très tamisé, alors je ne voyais pas bien le plat et j'avais faim. Après que j'ai mis du parmesan fourni par le serveur  et poivre moulu de tavle(le serveur nous a pas dit s'il y avait du poivre frais), je me rends compte que ce n'est pas le plat de fruit de mer...mais bien celui fe crevettes et champignons. J'y ai goutté..un peu trop de crème à mon goût et je voulais mes pâtes aux fruits de mer...alors obliger de dire au serveur et d'attendre une quinzaine de minutes pour qu'on me fasse le plat que j'ai demandé 2 fois...En attendant, je mangeais les frites de mon amie hehehe...elles étaient sec et dur.

Elle me dis que son saumon du tartare goûte bizarre. Je goûte et effectivement..un goût de poisson cuit avec du citron. Je regarde donc avec la lumière de mon cell et effectivement le saumon était rose cuit. Ça veut dire que le tartare n'était pas frais et à sûrement passé des heures mariné dans le citron...Le serveur a été mis au courant et a offert à mon amie si elle voulait autre chose ..le non a été sa réponse. 

Vu qu'elle a pris la table d'hôte, elle avait le droit à un café. Le café arrive...et met le lait et elle ne dit..NONNN ok là ça ne va pas...UNE BOULE ÉTAIT FORMÉ DANS LE PETIT TRUC DE LAIT TELLEMENT QU'IL ÉTAIT VIEUX WASHHH. Bref..le serveur s'est excusé et il a été voir le gérant et le souper lui a été offert...

Mettons que je ne retournerai sûrement pas...!"	5	4	2	['un', 'avi', 'de', 'mai', 'vue', 'que', 'mon', 'ami', 'na', 'pa', 'pay', 'son', 'repa', 'et', 'que', 'le', 'serveur', 'courtoi', 'je', 'met', 'une', 'toil', 'de', 'plusalor', 'lavi', 'va', 'comm', 'suitmercredi', 'soir', 'au', 'dbut', 'dcembr', 'h', 'la', 'gross', 'pancart', 'sur', 'la', 'qui', 'annonait', 'le', 'spcial', 'pour', 'avait', 'attir', 'mon', 'attent', 'alor', 'cherchant', 'une', 'place', 'pa', 'cher', 'pour', 'manger', 'nou', 'avon', 'dcid', 'daller', 'lbaserreur', 'premir', 'je', 'sai', 'que', 'ce', 'nest', 'pa', 'la', 'faut', 'au', 'resto', 'mai', 'il', 'est', 'quand', 'mme', 'difficil', 'de', 'trouver', 'lendroit', 'en', 'auto', 'ce', 'nest', 'pa', 'trop', 'bien', 'expliqu', 'bref', 'nou', 'rentron', 'l', 'le', 'resto', 'quelqu', 'clientsgenr', 'une', 'quinzain', 'lhte', 'hyper', 'amical', 'nou', 'placer', 'sur', 'une', 'banquett', 'alor', 'je', 'regard', 'le', 'menu', 'de', 'pauvr', 'pour', 'et', 'bien', 'il', 'ntait', 'pa', 'trop', 'attray', 'et', 'il', 'avait', 'le', 'autr', 'platsl', 'fruit', 'de', 'mer', 'avec', 'pte', 'mattrayait', 'et', 'mon', 'ami', 'dcid', 'de', 'suivr', 'mai', 'avec', 'la', 'tabl', 'dhte', 'ell', 'pri', 'un', 'tartar', 'au', 'saumon', 'et', 'moi', 'le', 'pte', 'aux', 'fruit', 'de', 'mer', 'le', 'serveur', 'amen', 'la', 'soup', 'de', 'mon', 'ami', 'quelqu', 'minut', 'plu', 'tard', 'le', 'serveur', 'est', 'venu', 'demand', 'si', 'cest', 'bel', 'et', 'bien', 'le', 'pte', 'avec', 'fruit', 'de', 'mer', 'et', 'non', 'celui', 'de', 'crevett', 'ptoncl', 'et', 'champignon', 'je', 'reconfirm', 'mon', 'plat', 'de', 'fruit', 'de', 'mer', 'en', 'attend', 'no', 'plat', 'demand', 'du', 'painctait', 'de', 'petit', 'baguettesdr', 'au', 'bout', 'mai', 'chaud', 'et', 'moelleus', 'au', 'milieu', 'alor', 'reoit', 'no', 'plat', 'la', 'lumir', 'est', 'tr', 'tami', 'alor', 'je', 'ne', 'voyai', 'pa', 'bien', 'le', 'plat', 'et', 'javai', 'faim', 'apr', 'que', 'jai', 'mi', 'du', 'parmesan', 'fourni', 'par', 'le', 'serveur', 'et', 'poivr', 'moulu', 'de', 'tavlel', 'serveur', 'nou', 'pa', 'dit', 'sil', 'avait', 'du', 'poivr', 'frai', 'je', 'rend', 'compt', 'que', 'ce', 'nest', 'pa', 'le', 'plat', 'de', 'fruit', 'de', 'mermai', 'bien', 'celui', 'fe', 'crevett', 'et', 'champignon', 'jy', 'ai', 'gouttun', 'peu', 'trop', 'de', 'crme', 'mon', 'got', 'et', 'je', 'voulai', 'me', 'pte', 'aux', 'fruit', 'de', 'meralor', 'oblig', 'de', 'dire', 'au', 'serveur', 'et', 'dattendr', 'une', 'quinzain', 'de', 'minut', 'pour', 'quon', 'fass', 'le', 'plat', 'que', 'jai', 'demand', 'foisen', 'attend', 'je', 'mangeai', 'le', 'frite', 'de', 'mon', 'ami', 'heheheel', 'taient', 'sec', 'et', 'durel', 'di', 'que', 'son', 'saumon', 'du', 'tartar', 'gote', 'bizarr', 'je', 'gote', 'et', 'effectivementun', 'got', 'de', 'poisson', 'cuit', 'avec', 'du', 'citron', 'je', 'regard', 'donc', 'avec', 'la', 'lumir', 'de', 'mon', 'cell', 'et', 'effectiv', 'le', 'saumon', 'tait', 'rose', 'cuit', 'veut', 'dire', 'que', 'le', 'tartar', 'ntait', 'pa', 'frai', 'et', 'srement', 'pass', 'de', 'heur', 'marin', 'dan', 'le', 'citronl', 'serveur', 'mi', 'au', 'courant', 'et', 'offert', 'mon', 'ami', 'si', 'ell', 'voulait', 'autr', 'chose', 'le', 'non', 'sa', 'rpons', 'vu', 'quell', 'pri', 'la', 'tabl', 'dhte', 'ell', 'avait', 'le', 'droit', 'un', 'caf', 'le', 'caf', 'arriveet', 'met', 'le', 'lait', 'et', 'ell', 'ne', 'ditnonnn', 'ok', 'l', 'ne', 'va', 'pasun', 'boul', 'tait', 'form', 'dan', 'le', 'petit', 'truc', 'de', 'lait', 'tellement', 'quil', 'tait', 'vieux', 'washhh', 'brefl', 'serveur', 'sest', 'excu', 'et', 'il', 'voir', 'le', 'grant', 'et', 'le', 'souper', 'lui', 'offertmetton', 'que', 'je', 'ne', 'retournerai', 'srement', 'pa']

Mais non, c'était bien correct. J'ai pris le sandwich à la dinde avec extra carrées de Mac&Cheese frit. Le Mac&Cheese j'ai bien aimé malgré qu'il était froid. Le sandwich était so so...une chance qu'il y avait deux sauces, une épicé (un peu épicé) et l'autre sweet. Les sauces etaient un peu vinaigré. 

J'étais avec un collègue et quand nous sommes rentré, il n'y avait aucun client. Je trouve que niveau espace, ils ont mal pensé. Il y a un comptoir haut avec des chaises qui donne face au mur. Manger devant un mur, ce n'est pas ce qu'il y a de plus exitant dans la vie. Et devant le resto, il y a deux tables à Pic nic de 8 places. Le resto avait tellement de trophée et bref je ne sais pas si c'est parce que j'ai pris la dinde que je n'ai pas trouver cela si bon. Il manquait d'épices et de goût. Par contre, quand on finissait de manger un groupe de 10 gars sont arrivé et ce sont assi à côté de nous, j'ai pu voir les autres plats , dont les ribs et la poutine qui avait un air succulent. J'essaierai cela la prochaine fois."	3	0	1	['avi', 'yelp', 'et', 'de', 'moyenn', 'je', 'mattendai', 'manger', 'quelqu', 'chose', 'de', 'wowwwww', 'mai', 'non', 'ctait', 'bien', 'correct', 'jai', 'pri', 'le', 'sandwich', 'la', 'dind', 'avec', 'extra', 'carr', 'de', 'macchees', 'frit', 'le', 'macchees', 'jai', 'bien', 'aim', 'malgr', 'quil', 'tait', 'froid', 'le', 'sandwich', 'tait', 'soun', 'chanc', 'quil', 'avait', 'deux', 'sauc', 'une', 'pic', 'un', 'peu', 'pic', 'et', 'lautr', 'sweet', 'le', 'sauc', 'etaient', 'un', 'peu', 'vinaigr', 'jtai', 'avec', 'un', 'collgu', 'et', 'quand', 'nou', 'somm', 'rentr', 'il', 'ny', 'avait', 'aucun', 'client', 'je', 'trouv', 'que', 'niveau', 'espac', 'il', 'ont', 'mal', 'pen', 'il', 'un', 'comptoir', 'haut', 'avec', 'de', 'chais', 'qui', 'donn', 'face', 'au', 'mur', 'manger', 'devant', 'un', 'mur', 'ce', 'nest', 'pa', 'ce', 'quil', 'de', 'plu', 'exit', 'dan', 'la', 'vie', 'et', 'devant', 'le', 'resto', 'il', 'deux', 'tabl', 'pic', 'nic', 'de', 'place', 'le', 'resto', 'avait', 'tellement', 'de', 'troph', 'et', 'bref', 'je', 'ne', 'sai', 'pa', 'si', 'cest', 'parc', 'que', 'jai', 'pri', 'la', 'dind', 'que', 'je', 'nai', 'pa', 'trouver', 'cela', 'si', 'bon', 'il', 'manquait', 'dpice', 'et', 'de', 'got', 'par', 'contr', 'quand', 'finissait', 'de', 'manger', 'un', 'group', 'de', 'gar', 'sont', 'arriv', 'et', 'ce', 'sont', 'assi', 'ct', 'de', 'nou', 'jai', 'pu', 'voir', 'le', 'autr', 'plat', 'dont', 'le', 'rib', 'et', 'la', 'poutin', 'qui', 'avait', 'un', 'air', 'succul', 'jessaierai', 'cela', 'la', 'prochain', 'foi']

Nous avons louer une quarantaine de chambres. Premièrement, nous avons eu la salle de réception 2h avant pour pouvoir préparer la salle. Ça passe, car nous avons été avertie d'avance. 

Ce qui ne passe pas c'est qu'ils ont appeler 3 jours d'avances pour nous dire qu'il y avait 26 chambres qui n'étaient pas prête suite aux rénovations. 26 CHAMBRES!!!!! 3 JOURS EN AVANCE, VOUS IMAGINEZ LE STRESS??? Ils nous ont donc offert d'aller au Quality Inn de St-sauveur qui est à environs 6-7 minutes d'auto et bien sûre un service de navette pour que personne ne prennent sa voiture, c'est quand même  le Party de Noël.... Bref, un système  de navette merdique. 

J'ai fini  de préparer  la salle vers 17h15 la navette est arrivé  à 17h55. Ils nous ont dit que le service serait au 15 minutes. J'ai demandé  à plusieurs employés  si c'était  possible d'appeler la navette. Ils m'ont  tous dit qu'elle s'en  venait. MENSONGE. Quand la navette  est arrivé, le chauffeur particulièrement  aimable et gentil, m'a dit que personne  ne l'avait appeler. Wow. Le souper était  correct...sans plus. 

J'ai pu voir les chambres  ""rénové"" Hahahaha Très  mal rénové.  Ça sentait encore la peinture. Les plintes  et les plaques d'interrupteurs  etaient très  mal placé.  Quelques interrupteurs  ne marchaient pas. 

Bref, tout ceux qui ont été placé à l'autre  Hôtel  et ceux dont  la chambre  était  mal rénové  ont reçu  une nuit gratuite  Si le tout ce déroule  bien, je vais bien-sûre  changer mon avis. Je vous tiendrais au courant :)"	0	0	0	['jespr', 'plu', 'jamai', 'remettr', 'le', 'pie', 'l', 'jai', 'organi', 'la', 'fte', 'de', 'nol', 'du', 'bureau', 'nou', 'avon', 'louer', 'une', 'quarantain', 'de', 'chambr', 'premir', 'nou', 'avon', 'eu', 'la', 'sall', 'de', 'rception', 'h', 'avant', 'pour', 'pouvoir', 'prparer', 'la', 'sall', 'pass', 'car', 'nou', 'avon', 'averti', 'davanc', 'ce', 'qui', 'ne', 'pass', 'pa', 'cest', 'quil', 'ont', 'appel', 'jour', 'davanc', 'pour', 'nou', 'dire', 'quil', 'avait', 'chambr', 'qui', 'ntaient', 'pa', 'prte', 'suit', 'aux', 'rnovat', 'chambr', 'jour', 'en', 'avanc', 'vou', 'imaginez', 'le', 'stress', 'il', 'nou', 'ont', 'donc', 'offert', 'daller', 'au', 'qualiti', 'inn', 'de', 'stsauveur', 'qui', 'est', 'environ', 'minut', 'dauto', 'et', 'bien', 'sre', 'un', 'servic', 'de', 'navett', 'pour', 'que', 'personn', 'ne', 'prennent', 'sa', 'voitur', 'cest', 'quand', 'mme', 'le', 'parti', 'de', 'nol', 'bref', 'un', 'systm', 'de', 'navett', 'merdiqu', 'jai', 'fini', 'de', 'prparer', 'la', 'sall', 'ver', 'h', 'la', 'navett', 'est', 'arriv', 'h', 'il', 'nou', 'ont', 'dit', 'que', 'le', 'servic', 'serait', 'au', 'minut', 'jai', 'demand', 'plusieur', 'employ', 'si', 'ctait', 'possibl', 'dappel', 'la', 'navett', 'il', 'mont', 'tou', 'dit', 'quell', 'sen', 'venait', 'mensong', 'quand', 'la', 'navett', 'est', 'arriv', 'le', 'chauffeur', 'particulir', 'aimabl', 'et', 'gentil', 'dit', 'que', 'personn', 'ne', 'lavait', 'appel', 'wow', 'le', 'souper', 'tait', 'correctsan', 'plu', 'jai', 'pu', 'voir', 'le', 'chambr', 'rnov', 'hahahaha', 'tr', 'mal', 'rnov', 'sentait', 'encor', 'la', 'peintur', 'le', 'plint', 'et', 'le', 'plaqu', 'dinterrupteur', 'etaient', 'tr', 'mal', 'plac', 'quelqu', 'interrupteur', 'ne', 'marchaient', 'pa', 'bref', 'tout', 'ceux', 'qui', 'ont', 'plac', 'lautr', 'htel', 'et', 'ceux', 'dont', 'la', 'chambr', 'tait', 'mal', 'rnov', 'ont', 'reu', 'une', 'nuit', 'gratuit', 'si', 'le', 'tout', 'ce', 'droul', 'bien', 'je', 'vai', 'biensr', 'changer', 'mon', 'avi', 'je', 'vou', 'tiendrai', 'au', 'courant']

Ceci étant dit, pour l'Halloween...j'adore me déguisé avec des vêtements de friperie et me concevoir un costume pas trop cher. 

En ayant vu les nouvelles pubs de Renaissance et de l'Halloween, je me suis dit que je devrais aller là et qu'il avait d'l'air à avoir beaucoup de choix. 

Dès qu'on rentre, on sent cette fameuse odeur de vieux vêtements qu'on sent dans toutes les magasins à grandes surfaces de vêtements usées. Une odeur de garde-robe\/poussière\/sensation bizarre quand tu touches les vêtements bref..En rentrant dans le magasin, la section Halloween était là. Il ne restait pas grand chose, même s'il restait au moins 6 jours pour le 31. On voyait que les accessoires  avaient eu du succès et qu'il ne restait pas grand chose. Je me suis donc mis à chercher dans la section de vêtements pour m'inspirer....sorcière...vieille dame...folle au chat....je ne savais pas...je ne trouvais rien... Il y avait vraiment beaucoup trop de monde partout...un méga line up pour les cabines d'essayage et pour payer...Je me croyais au Zara en période de méga solde. Finalement, je suis tombé sur une jupe longue magnifique bohemienne. Certes je vais là garder  et la porter un jour...et j'ai eu l'idée de Hippie. Je me suis donc mis à chercher des accessoires et un chandail qui pourrait compléter mon costume.

J'étais sceptique à l'idée d'aller dans un bar du vieux port sans talon haut et sans être sur mon 36. Mais bref, vu que j'étais avec un habitué je me suis dit d'accord j'y vais pour un verre...4 verres plus tard, ma soirée à fini à la fermeture. Le staff est super gentil, autant des bouncers qui se pensent pas au dessus de toi, que les barmaid et la fille du coatcheck. En passant, tout le monde du staff est bien classy. Le seul verre que j'ai payé, je m'attendais à le payer 10 ou +. Mais non un beau gros 7$ + tx et surprise, il goûtait l'alcool généreusement. J'ai pris un rhum 7up (Désolé je suis plate question cocktail) L'endroit était bien rempli et la musique super bonne. J'ai ecouté du rock n roll, comme des classiques, des toutes de la compagnie créole, samba, Magic system, de la musique populaire du moment et plus. La place est bien rempli par contre pas de place pour s'assoir et on s'entend qu'il n'y a pas de piste de dance...on créé notre propre piste. Bref, belle découverte du vieux. Ah oui, les toilettes sont propres et il y en plus qu'une!!	0	0	0	['vendredi', 'soir', 'je', 'sui', 'avec', 'mon', 'ami', 'qui', 'habit', 'proximit', 'et', 'qui', 'est', 'un', 'habitu', 'du', 'philmon', 'jtai', 'sceptiqu', 'lide', 'daller', 'dan', 'un', 'bar', 'du', 'vieux', 'port', 'san', 'talon', 'haut', 'et', 'san', 'tre', 'sur', 'mon', 'mai', 'bref', 'vu', 'que', 'jtai', 'avec', 'un', 'habitu', 'je', 'sui', 'dit', 'daccord', 'jy', 'vai', 'pour', 'un', 'verr', 'verr', 'plu', 'tard', 'soir', 'fini', 'la', 'fermetur', 'le', 'staff', 'est', 'super', 'gentil', 'autant', 'de', 'bouncer', 'qui', 'se', 'pensent', 'pa', 'au', 'dessu', 'de', 'toi', 'que', 'le', 'barmaid', 'et', 'la', 'fill', 'du', 'coatcheck', 'en', 'passant', 'tout', 'le', 'mond', 'du', 'staff', 'est', 'bien', 'classi', 'le', 'seul', 'verr', 'que', 'jai', 'pay', 'je', 'mattendai', 'le', 'payer', 'ou', 'mai', 'non', 'un', 'beau', 'gro', 'tx', 'et', 'surpris', 'il', 'gotait', 'lalcool', 'gnreusement', 'jai', 'pri', 'un', 'rhum', 'dsol', 'je', 'sui', 'plate', 'question', 'cocktail', 'lendroit', 'tait', 'bien', 'rempli', 'et', 'la', 'musiqu', 'super', 'bonn', 'jai', 'ecout', 'du', 'rock', 'n', 'roll', 'comm', 'de', 'classiqu', 'de', 'tout', 'de', 'la', 'compagni', 'crole', 'samba', 'magic', 'system', 'de', 'la', 'musiqu', 'populair', 'du', 'moment', 'et', 'plu', 'la', 'place', 'est', 'bien', 'rempli', 'par', 'contr', 'pa', 'de', 'place', 'pour', 'sassoir', 'et', 'sentend', 'quil', 'ny', 'pa', 'de', 'pist', 'de', 'danceon', 'cr', 'notr', 'propr', 'pist', 'bref', 'bell', 'dcouvert', 'du', 'vieux', 'ah', 'oui', 'le', 'toilett', 'sont', 'propr', 'et', 'il', 'en', 'plu', 'quun']

Rendu chez une amie vers 3h du matin et sur Guy et St-Antoine, nous commencions à avoir faim. Et à part une pizzeria louche de Verdun, il n'y avait pas de resto ouvert pour la livraison. Il fallait donc se déplacer pour manger. Désolé je ne suis pas assez riche pour foodora ou ubereat... Et du Mcdo..et bien, j'en ai mangé 3 fois en 2 semaines..  Anyways

 C'est alors que Yelp m'a aidé à trouver un resto à proximité et ouvert....Le Boustan était le choix judicieux! Nous nous sommes donc aventurer sur la rue des très jeunes  soupçons des sorties de clubs, qui chill encore à 3h40, car c'est sûrement leur première sortie avec Fake ID, je parle de la rue Crescent! Arrivé devant le fameux Boustan, il y en avait des petits jeunes souls avec leur spinner..et un line -up. Malgré le line-up, ça n'a pas pris de temps pour se faire servir! J'ai pris un classique
..le trio sandwich poulet, avec patates! 

Malgré mon ancienne vie de débauche, qui incluait des fois la rue Crescent, je n'avais jamais essayé le Boustan de Crescent. J'avais été à celui de Rivière-des-Prairies, qui était ok..mais sans plus...tsé tout est bon en y ajoutant de l'ail ou presque...! Il y avait du monde qui me parlait du Boustan...que c'était donc ben bon et tout...mais bon je ne les comprenais pas...car à RdP comme je vous dit c'était ordinaire...

Bref, sur mes patates j'ai demandé Humus et sauce à l'ail. J'adore quand le gars derrière le comptoir prend la cuillère remplie de sauce et y va d'un élan pour que la sauce tombe adéquatement sur les patates! Quand j'ai goûter au sandwich..j'ai compris pourquoi les gens capotait autant!! Le sandwich est tout chaud tout croustillant! Le poulet est malade mental  et les patates wow! Bref, c'est sûre que je recommande le Boustan peut importe l'heure! J'ai bien hâte d'y retourner miam!"	1	0	1	['je', 'sui', 'sorti', 'jusqu', 'tard', 'apr', 'de', 'moi', 'et', 'de', 'moi', 'rendu', 'chez', 'une', 'ami', 'ver', 'h', 'du', 'matin', 'et', 'sur', 'guy', 'et', 'stantoin', 'nou', 'commencion', 'avoir', 'faim', 'et', 'part', 'une', 'pizzeria', 'louch', 'de', 'verdun', 'il', 'ny', 'avait', 'pa', 'de', 'resto', 'ouvert', 'pour', 'la', 'livraison', 'il', 'fallait', 'donc', 'se', 'dplacer', 'pour', 'manger', 'dsol', 'je', 'ne', 'sui', 'pa', 'assez', 'rich', 'pour', 'foodora', 'ou', 'ubereat', 'et', 'du', 'mcdoet', 'bien', 'jen', 'ai', 'mang', 'foi', 'en', 'semain', 'anyway', 'cest', 'alor', 'que', 'yelp', 'aid', 'trouver', 'un', 'resto', 'proximit', 'et', 'ouvertl', 'boustan', 'tait', 'le', 'choix', 'judicieux', 'nou', 'nou', 'somm', 'donc', 'aventur', 'sur', 'la', 'rue', 'de', 'tr', 'jeun', 'soupon', 'de', 'sorti', 'de', 'club', 'qui', 'chill', 'encor', 'h', 'car', 'cest', 'srement', 'leur', 'premir', 'sorti', 'avec', 'fake', 'id', 'je', 'parl', 'de', 'la', 'rue', 'crescent', 'arriv', 'devant', 'le', 'fameux', 'boustan', 'il', 'en', 'avait', 'de', 'petit', 'jeun', 'soul', 'avec', 'leur', 'spinneret', 'un', 'line', 'malgr', 'le', 'lineup', 'na', 'pa', 'pri', 'de', 'temp', 'pour', 'se', 'fair', 'servir', 'jai', 'pri', 'un', 'classiquel', 'trio', 'sandwich', 'poulet', 'avec', 'patat', 'malgr', 'mon', 'ancienn', 'vie', 'de', 'dbauch', 'qui', 'incluait', 'de', 'foi', 'la', 'rue', 'crescent', 'je', 'navai', 'jamai', 'essay', 'le', 'boustan', 'de', 'crescent', 'javai', 'celui', 'de', 'riviredesprairi', 'qui', 'tait', 'okmai', 'san', 'plust', 'tout', 'est', 'bon', 'en', 'ajout', 'de', 'lail', 'ou', 'presqu', 'il', 'avait', 'du', 'mond', 'qui', 'parlait', 'du', 'boustanqu', 'ctait', 'donc', 'ben', 'bon', 'et', 'toutmai', 'bon', 'je', 'ne', 'le', 'comprenai', 'pascar', 'rdp', 'comm', 'je', 'vou', 'dit', 'ctait', 'ordinairebref', 'sur', 'me', 'patat', 'jai', 'demand', 'humu', 'et', 'sauc', 'lail', 'jador', 'quand', 'le', 'gar', 'derrir', 'le', 'comptoir', 'prend', 'la', 'cuillr', 'rempli', 'de', 'sauc', 'et', 'va', 'dun', 'lan', 'pour', 'que', 'la', 'sauc', 'tomb', 'adquat', 'sur', 'le', 'patat', 'quand', 'jai', 'goter', 'au', 'sandwichjai', 'compri', 'pourquoi', 'le', 'gen', 'capotait', 'autant', 'le', 'sandwich', 'est', 'tout', 'chaud', 'tout', 'croustil', 'le', 'poulet', 'est', 'malad', 'mental', 'et', 'le', 'patat', 'wow', 'bref', 'cest', 'sre', 'que', 'je', 'recommand', 'le', 'boustan', 'peut', 'import', 'lheur', 'jai', 'bien', 'hte', 'dy', 'retourn', 'miam']

J'étais malade des intestins, alors je n'ai pas pu trop goûter ce qu'il y avait dans le resto ou cafétéria mais j'ai pu voir de mes propres yeux et vous écrire mon avis. Il faut savoir aussi que l'hôpital est situé dans un secteur résidentiel, donc il n'y a pas grand chose aux alentours. Pour cette évaluation, je vais diviser les endroits visité dans l'hôpital. 

LES URGENCES: C'était la première fois que j'y allais à ses Urgences. Un peu compliqué de s'y retrouver dans le processus d'inscription et de triage. Premièrement, il faut prendre un numéro, comme dans le comptoir à charcuterie dans une épicerie. Ensuite, on passe au triage avec un gentil infirmier. Après, c'est l'inscription, avec une madame qui on dirait est toujours occupé avec son ordi. Cela peut prendre 10 minutes avant qu'elle se rend compte qu'il y a quelqu'un assis sur son bureau devant elle. Soyez chanceux, qu'une fois qu'on vous appelle, le docteur et l'infirmière font les tests très rapidement. Nous n'avons pas besoin d'attendre une autre heure pour voir le docteur dans la salle de consultation. Prévoyez un bon deux heures pour avoir les résultats d'examens.

LE BISTRO DU REZ-DE-CHAUSSÉE: Il est propre, il sent bon. Il y a un beau menu du jour. Il y a quelques petits articles déjà préparer que nous pouvons acheter et c'est un mini dépanneur. Il y a une vingtaine de places assises. Le staff très gentil. J'ai été acheter un thé, un muffin et un café (pour ma maman). J'ai pu regarder le menu. Simple. Par contre un trio deux hot-dogs, frites et boisson à 10-12$, cela devient cher. En même temps, après avoir vu la cafétéria du bas, on préfère payer le prix. En plus, le bistro est ouvert pas mal toute la journée et ce jusqu'à 21h.

LA CAFÉTÉRIA DU SOUS-SOL: Une vrai cafétéria douteuse d'hôpital. Ouf le menu du jour. Une soupe au légume avec hamburger. Ma mère a manger cela. Je n'ai jamais vu un burger aussi dégoûtant. Certes, le prix n'est pas cher. La station des condiments de burger fait peur et n'a pas l'air propre. De même que le cuisinier ou le monsieur du comptoir...mais bon je tiens à ne pas dire de méchanceté gratuite sur l'apparence. Mais un peu plus d'entousiasme au monsieur ne ferait pas de tord."	1	0	0	['un', 'avi', 'sur', 'un', 'hpital', 'yeah', 'pendant', 'mon', 'h', 'pass', 'aux', 'urgenc', 'jai', 'pu', 'promen', 'un', 'peu', 'jtai', 'malad', 'de', 'intestin', 'alor', 'je', 'nai', 'pa', 'pu', 'trop', 'goter', 'ce', 'quil', 'avait', 'dan', 'le', 'resto', 'ou', 'caftria', 'mai', 'jai', 'pu', 'voir', 'de', 'me', 'propr', 'yeux', 'et', 'vou', 'crire', 'mon', 'avi', 'il', 'faut', 'savoir', 'aussi', 'que', 'lhpital', 'est', 'situ', 'dan', 'un', 'secteur', 'rsidentiel', 'donc', 'il', 'ny', 'pa', 'grand', 'chose', 'aux', 'alentour', 'pour', 'cett', 'valuat', 'je', 'vai', 'divis', 'le', 'endroit', 'visit', 'dan', 'lhpital', 'le', 'urgenc', 'ctait', 'la', 'premir', 'foi', 'que', 'jy', 'allai', 'se', 'urgenc', 'un', 'peu', 'compliqu', 'de', 'sy', 'retrouv', 'dan', 'le', 'processu', 'dinscript', 'et', 'de', 'triag', 'premir', 'il', 'faut', 'prendr', 'un', 'numro', 'comm', 'dan', 'le', 'comptoir', 'charcuteri', 'dan', 'une', 'piceri', 'ensuit', 'pass', 'au', 'triag', 'avec', 'un', 'gentil', 'infirmi', 'apr', 'cest', 'linscript', 'avec', 'une', 'madam', 'qui', 'dirait', 'est', 'toujour', 'occup', 'avec', 'son', 'ordi', 'cela', 'peut', 'prendr', 'minut', 'avant', 'quell', 'se', 'rend', 'compt', 'quil', 'quelquun', 'assi', 'sur', 'son', 'bureau', 'devant', 'ell', 'soyez', 'chanceux', 'quun', 'foi', 'quon', 'vou', 'appel', 'le', 'docteur', 'et', 'linfirmir', 'font', 'le', 'test', 'tr', 'rapid', 'nou', 'navon', 'pa', 'besoin', 'dattendr', 'une', 'autr', 'heur', 'pour', 'voir', 'le', 'docteur', 'dan', 'la', 'sall', 'de', 'consult', 'prvoyez', 'un', 'bon', 'deux', 'heur', 'pour', 'avoir', 'le', 'rsultat', 'dexamensl', 'bistro', 'du', 'rezdechauss', 'il', 'est', 'propr', 'il', 'sent', 'bon', 'il', 'un', 'beau', 'menu', 'du', 'jour', 'il', 'quelqu', 'petit', 'articl', 'dj', 'prparer', 'que', 'nou', 'pouvon', 'achet', 'et', 'cest', 'un', 'mini', 'dpanneur', 'il', 'une', 'vingtain', 'de', 'place', 'assis', 'le', 'staff', 'tr', 'gentil', 'jai', 'achet', 'un', 'th', 'un', 'muffin', 'et', 'un', 'caf', 'pour', 'maman', 'jai', 'pu', 'regard', 'le', 'menu', 'simpl', 'par', 'contr', 'un', 'trio', 'deux', 'hotdog', 'frite', 'et', 'boisson', 'cela', 'devient', 'cher', 'en', 'mme', 'temp', 'apr', 'avoir', 'vu', 'la', 'caftria', 'du', 'ba', 'prfre', 'payer', 'le', 'prix', 'en', 'plu', 'le', 'bistro', 'est', 'ouvert', 'pa', 'mal', 'tout', 'la', 'journ', 'et', 'ce', 'jusqu', 'hla', 'caftria', 'du', 'soussol', 'une', 'vrai', 'caftria', 'douteus', 'dhpital', 'ouf', 'le', 'menu', 'du', 'jour', 'une', 'soup', 'au', 'lgume', 'avec', 'hamburg', 'mre', 'manger', 'cela', 'je', 'nai', 'jamai', 'vu', 'un', 'burger', 'aussi', 'dgotant', 'cert', 'le', 'prix', 'nest', 'pa', 'cher', 'la', 'station', 'de', 'condiment', 'de', 'burger', 'fait', 'peur', 'et', 'na', 'pa', 'lair', 'propr', 'de', 'mme', 'que', 'le', 'cuisini', 'ou', 'le', 'monsieur', 'du', 'comptoirmai', 'bon', 'je', 'tien', 'ne', 'pa', 'dire', 'de', 'mchancet', 'gratuit', 'sur', 'lappar', 'mai', 'un', 'peu', 'plu', 'dentousiasm', 'au', 'monsieur', 'ne', 'ferait', 'pa', 'de', 'tord']

Bref, j'étais invité pour un anniversaire au Kanda Sushi de St-Léonard. La fameuse chaine de restaurant  de All you can eat Sushi, dont je n'avais jamais été. Elle est situé aux abords du fameux Carrefour Langelier.

Mon intérêt d'aller là était plus ou moins élevé, par contre, quand on m'a annoncé que c'était un KANDA PLUS, ce qui voulait dire un APPORTEZ VOTRE VIN, j'ai commencé à m'en réjouir de plus en plus. 

Dès que nous sommes arrivé, nous avions le choix de sushi et de mets variables dans des feuilles où nous devions cocher et choisir les quantité. Les serveurs sont venu nous voir plusieurs fois pour vérifié si nous avions des questions. Ils ont été très vite à nous servir de l'eau et nous amener des seaux pour les bouteilles de vino. Une fois la commande passé, les sushis sont arrivés extrêmement vite. Je ne sais pas s'ils étaient fait d'avance, mais ils étaient délicieux. Certes, ce n'est pas les plus ""on point"" mais un gros 7\/10 en général pour les différents maki que j'ai goûté. 

Pour ce qui est de la bouffe, j'ai adoré la crevette tempura, calmars sel et poivre et le pad thai a été le plat favori de notre table. J'ai goûté le tartare, c'était bon, mais c'était plus des morceaux d'avocats avec par dessus du saumon frais avec un coulis d'huile de sésame et des grains de sésame. 

Nous étions un des derniers groupes à quitter. Nous n'avons pas senti le sentiment de pression qu'il fallait quitter OPC. Bref, pour 40$ je suis resté satisfaite, et c'est sûre que j'y retourne. Personnel super amical et courtois, la rapidité du resto et la propreté sont un plus pour ce resto.

La première fois, j'aurai donné un gros 2* et je n'ai  pas fait de reviews sorry :(  . Je m'étais gâté avec une brochette poitrine de poulet avec riz et salade. Je feelais ""santé""  cette journée  là. Dégueulasse. Le poulet étais sec et sans goût.  La salade avec de la petite  sauce francaise  sur le côté. Boff....et le riz ARQUE. le pouding  au riz était  correct avec beaucoup de sirop. 

Mais là quand je suis retourné, je ne sais pas si c'est  car  j'avais  faim mais c'était  bon. Okey la soupe  c'était  sûrement  de la soupe en canne  avec de l'eau  et du sel rajouté. Mais la pizza était très  mangeable. Mon ami à pris une Lasagne. Une immense portion qui est casi impossible  de terminer tout seul. 

Je comprends pourquoi  que ce resto  est si populaire, il a beaucoup de combinaison  et ça  ne coute pas cher.

Premièrement, permettez-moi  de vous dire que le staff est superbe. Ça fesait longtemps  que je ne me sentais pas aussi bien accueilli  dans un endroit. 

Attention de bien connaître  l'adresse, sinon vous risquez de passer tout droit. L'Anticafé est situé  en plein coeur du Quartier  des spectacles sur Ste-Catherine. On peut se sentir un peu gêner d'ouvrir  la porte la première  fois, car nous ne savons pas trop si on est au bon endroit. Mais bon oui on y ait! À notre arrivée  on est acceuilli par de gentilles  personnes qui nous posent des questions  du genre, est-ce  votre première  fois? Connaissez -vous le concept etc etc. On est aussi inviter à enlever  nos grosses bottes d'hiver  pour mettre des pantoufles. Pour ceux qui ont peur de se faire voler les bottes, mes bottes  coûtent 400$ et je n'ai  pas eu peur de me les faire voler. Aussi,  si jamais vous êtes  dédaigneux  de porter des pantoufles, vous pouvez toujours  ne pas en porter ou bien apporter les vôtres. 

Alors le concept, payez pour le temps que vous restez. 3$\/h jusqu'à  un max de 9$ par jour. Sur place, du café , du thé, des biscuits, des pretzels, des bonbons etc etc. Il y a aussi une machine à expresso, latte, moca qui doit être  utilisé  par le staff seulement. On nous demande simplement de laver notre tasse par la suite. Un peu comme dans une auberge de jeunesse tse. Il y a plein de salles differentes et salon sur deux étages. Vous faites  comme chez vous, même  apportez votre lunch. Il y a un micro-onde  aussi. Bref concept ben le fun.

Pas de 5*, car les toilettes  n'ont  pas de lavabo  pour ce laver les mains et que ça ferme à 11h :("	1	0	0	['anticaf', 'un', 'concept', 'adopt', 'jen', 'veux', 'plu', 'de', 'endroit', 'comm', 'cela', 'je', 'sui', 'all', 'deux', 'foi', 'dj', 'premir', 'permettezmoi', 'de', 'vou', 'dire', 'que', 'le', 'staff', 'est', 'superb', 'fesait', 'longtemp', 'que', 'je', 'ne', 'sentai', 'pa', 'aussi', 'bien', 'accueilli', 'dan', 'un', 'endroit', 'attent', 'de', 'bien', 'connatr', 'ladress', 'sinon', 'vou', 'risquez', 'de', 'passer', 'tout', 'droit', 'lanticaf', 'est', 'situ', 'en', 'plein', 'coeur', 'du', 'quartier', 'de', 'spectacl', 'sur', 'stecatherin', 'peut', 'se', 'sentir', 'un', 'peu', 'gner', 'douvrir', 'la', 'port', 'la', 'premir', 'foi', 'car', 'nou', 'ne', 'savon', 'pa', 'trop', 'si', 'est', 'au', 'bon', 'endroit', 'mai', 'bon', 'oui', 'ait', 'notr', 'arriv', 'est', 'acceuilli', 'par', 'de', 'gentil', 'personn', 'qui', 'nou', 'posent', 'de', 'question', 'du', 'genr', 'estc', 'votr', 'premir', 'foi', 'connaissez', 'vou', 'le', 'concept', 'etc', 'etc', 'est', 'aussi', 'invit', 'enlev', 'no', 'gross', 'bott', 'dhiver', 'pour', 'mettr', 'de', 'pantoufl', 'pour', 'ceux', 'qui', 'ont', 'peur', 'de', 'se', 'fair', 'voler', 'le', 'bott', 'me', 'bott', 'cotent', 'et', 'je', 'nai', 'pa', 'eu', 'peur', 'de', 'le', 'fair', 'voler', 'aussi', 'si', 'jamai', 'vou', 'te', 'ddaigneux', 'de', 'porter', 'de', 'pantoufl', 'vou', 'pouvez', 'toujour', 'ne', 'pa', 'en', 'porter', 'ou', 'bien', 'apport', 'le', 'vtre', 'alor', 'le', 'concept', 'payez', 'pour', 'le', 'temp', 'que', 'vou', 'restez', 'h', 'jusqu', 'un', 'max', 'de', 'par', 'jour', 'sur', 'place', 'du', 'caf', 'du', 'th', 'de', 'biscuit', 'de', 'pretzel', 'de', 'bonbon', 'etc', 'etc', 'il', 'aussi', 'une', 'machin', 'expresso', 'latt', 'moca', 'qui', 'doit', 'tre', 'utili', 'par', 'le', 'staff', 'seulement', 'nou', 'demand', 'simplement', 'de', 'laver', 'notr', 'tass', 'par', 'la', 'suit', 'un', 'peu', 'comm', 'dan', 'une', 'auberg', 'de', 'jeuness', 'tse', 'il', 'plein', 'de', 'sall', 'different', 'et', 'salon', 'sur', 'deux', 'tage', 'vou', 'fait', 'comm', 'chez', 'vou', 'mme', 'apportez', 'votr', 'lunch', 'il', 'un', 'microond', 'aussi', 'bref', 'concept', 'ben', 'le', 'funpa', 'de', 'car', 'le', 'toilett', 'nont', 'pa', 'de', 'lavabo', 'pour', 'ce', 'laver', 'le', 'main', 'et', 'que', 'ferm', 'h']

Nous cherchons un endroit pour prendre un verre et un propose cet endroit. De l'extérieur je suis vendu. Je vois pleins de bouteilles et un gros écriteau avec JEUDI OLD SCHOOL SPECIAUX etc etc. Ouain......je ne savais pas que Old school pour le DJ c'était Julie Masse, de la musique pas dansante et triste. Bref de la musique hyper déprimante. Je vais aux toilettes, les toilettes sont au deuxième et mixte...whats up l'intimité. Non pas que ça me dérange sauf que...c'est minuscule 2 toilettes pour couvrir beaucoup de gens gars et filles. Et on s'entends on est dans le vieux, pas au Milend ou dans le Village, alors on risque de retrouver des gens moins ouvert d'esprit. Bref, il y avait beaucoup de gens de bureau qui on dirait avaient allongé leur 5@ tard. Quelques personnes dans un état d'ivresse level 100000. Le service est lent. Par contre, on a une table pour 7. Trop sombre pour regarder le menu de cocktail et la musique continue à être déprimante. J'allume ma lampe de poche de cell. Il y a beaucoup beaucoup beaucoup de choix de cocktail!! En effet, avec les centaines de bouteilles qu'il y a sur le mur derrière le bar, cela ce comprend. Il y a une feuille de spéciaux. Bien sûre, nous sommes 7, mais seulement une seule feuille avec les speciaux nous est attribué. J'ai pris un Pisco Sour. Il est fait avec du blanc d'oeuf.  Très bon, mais un peu fort. Mes collègues avaient l'air satisfait avec leur drink. En plus ils sont en bas de 9$. 

Je prends ensuite une Sleeman en bouteille qui est en special à 3.91$ et le serveur me dit elles sont à 2 pour 8,50$ et je le regarde en lui disant ben sur le menu c'est écrit 3.91$. Il me regarde d'un air bête et me reponds..tu connais le menu mieux que moi... Bref...Oui j'y retournerai mais en 5@7. Car à 10h plus jamais. C'est un bar qui ma fortement dessus pour un jeudi soir."	0	1	0	['jeudi', 'soir', 'h', 'pm', 'je', 'sui', 'avec', 'de', 'collgu', 'nou', 'cherchon', 'un', 'endroit', 'pour', 'prendr', 'un', 'verr', 'et', 'un', 'propos', 'cet', 'endroit', 'de', 'lextrieur', 'je', 'sui', 'vendu', 'je', 'voi', 'plein', 'de', 'bouteil', 'et', 'un', 'gro', 'criteau', 'avec', 'jeudi', 'old', 'school', 'speciaux', 'etc', 'etc', 'ouainj', 'ne', 'savai', 'pa', 'que', 'old', 'school', 'pour', 'le', 'dj', 'ctait', 'juli', 'mass', 'de', 'la', 'musiqu', 'pa', 'dansant', 'et', 'trist', 'bref', 'de', 'la', 'musiqu', 'hyper', 'dprimant', 'je', 'vai', 'aux', 'toilett', 'le', 'toilett', 'sont', 'au', 'deuxim', 'et', 'mixtewhat', 'lintimit', 'non', 'pa', 'que', 'drang', 'sauf', 'quecest', 'minuscul', 'toilett', 'pour', 'couvrir', 'beaucoup', 'de', 'gen', 'gar', 'et', 'fill', 'et', 'sentend', 'est', 'dan', 'le', 'vieux', 'pa', 'au', 'milend', 'ou', 'dan', 'le', 'villag', 'alor', 'risqu', 'de', 'retrouv', 'de', 'gen', 'moin', 'ouvert', 'desprit', 'bref', 'il', 'avait', 'beaucoup', 'de', 'gen', 'de', 'bureau', 'qui', 'dirait', 'avaient', 'allong', 'leur', 'tard', 'quelqu', 'personn', 'dan', 'un', 'tat', 'divress', 'level', 'le', 'servic', 'est', 'lent', 'par', 'contr', 'une', 'tabl', 'pour', 'trop', 'sombr', 'pour', 'regard', 'le', 'menu', 'de', 'cocktail', 'et', 'la', 'musiqu', 'continu', 'tre', 'dprimant', 'jallum', 'lamp', 'de', 'poch', 'de', 'cell', 'il', 'beaucoup', 'beaucoup', 'beaucoup', 'de', 'choix', 'de', 'cocktail', 'en', 'effet', 'avec', 'le', 'centain', 'de', 'bouteil', 'quil', 'sur', 'le', 'mur', 'derrir', 'le', 'bar', 'cela', 'ce', 'comprend', 'il', 'une', 'feuill', 'de', 'spciaux', 'bien', 'sre', 'nou', 'somm', 'mai', 'seulement', 'une', 'seul', 'feuill', 'avec', 'le', 'speciaux', 'nou', 'est', 'attribu', 'jai', 'pri', 'un', 'pisco', 'sour', 'il', 'est', 'fait', 'avec', 'du', 'blanc', 'doeuf', 'tr', 'bon', 'mai', 'un', 'peu', 'fort', 'me', 'collgu', 'avaient', 'lair', 'satisfait', 'avec', 'leur', 'drink', 'en', 'plu', 'il', 'sont', 'en', 'ba', 'de', 'je', 'prend', 'ensuit', 'une', 'sleeman', 'en', 'bouteil', 'qui', 'est', 'en', 'special', 'et', 'le', 'serveur', 'dit', 'ell', 'sont', 'pour', 'et', 'je', 'le', 'regard', 'en', 'lui', 'disant', 'ben', 'sur', 'le', 'menu', 'cest', 'crit', 'il', 'regard', 'dun', 'air', 'bte', 'et', 'repondstu', 'connai', 'le', 'menu', 'mieux', 'que', 'moi', 'brefoui', 'jy', 'retournerai', 'mai', 'en', 'car', 'h', 'plu', 'jamai', 'cest', 'un', 'bar', 'qui', 'fortement', 'dessu', 'pour', 'un', 'jeudi', 'soir']

Je croyais avant d'y aller que je devais consommer une boisson=un plat et tse vu que les plats ne sont pas immense et que j'aime bien l'alcool et la bouffe.....j'allais être ben pompette et que ca allait me coûter une fortune. Mais non, c'est belle et bien à l'achat d'une boisson TU MANGES TOUS LES PLATS QUE TU VEUX POUR 5$.

J'y ai été 2 fois déjà et les deux fois un samedi. Une fois à deux où nous avons attendu un gros 10-15 min et nous étions placé dans la table avec 2 inconnus, mais ne vous inquiétez pas, ils vous demandent si ça vous dérange de partager la table et les tables sont grandes :) et la deuxième fois à quatre où on a attendu une vingtaine de minutes. Pas pire pas pire comme temps. 

Parlons maintenant de bouffe et d'alcool : J'ai goûté le bris fondant, le tartare, les calmars, les linguinis et une salade ah oui et j'ai volé une bouché de poutine à une amie.  Mon préféré les linguinis!! Avec peux d'ingrédients ils ont pu faire quelque chose de délicieux . Le bris aussi était ben bon. Pour le reste ne vous attendez pas à de la grande gastronomie, tse un tartare à 5$. Il est passable et frais ce qui est important. Ne chialez pas si vous savez que votre plat vous à coûté 5$. Bref, j'ai bien aimé le drink vedette soit le Costa Rica! mmm delicieux. Le mojito rose aussi et le Palomita à goûter absoluement si vous aimez la tequila. Un samedi quand j'ai été, il y avait un spécial sur la belle gueule 5 BIÈRES POUR 4.90$ OMG.

Pour ce qui est du service. Je l'avoue il est un peu lent. Un autre serveur ne ferait pas de tord. Par contre, les serveuses et les autres du staff sont très très attentionné et à l'écoute. Une belle gang...

Le concept: C'est une poissonnerie, où on choisi ce qu'on veut manger et ils nous cuit cela sur place, grillé, frit, avec sauces etc. Le calmar frit et les crevettes Tigers sont délicieuses. Prochaine fois, je vais essayer les crevettes avec beurre et ail..! Un gros  aux patates, elles sont délicieuses. J'ai goûter la salade maison, fish and chip, pieuvre et c'est tout je crois. C'était assez haha! 

Ah oui, malgré que le riz du Moyen-Orient est délicieux, ici il était fade. Je vous le déconseille. Demandez de la sauce tartare, très bonne. 

Des étoiles de moins, pour le service..ils ne sont pas venu nous voir, il fallait demander constamment des trucs, de l'eau de la sauce ou autre boisson.

Attention, il n'y a pas d'alcool. C'est un resto musulman et c'est Haram. Mais ce n'est pas pour cela que j'enlève des étoiles :) Je retournerai très vite.

Ah et aussi que je découvre qu'avec du Ketchup, la poutine est 1000 fois meilleure.

Ceci étant dit, j'ai essayé poutineville pour la première fois. Plusieurs poutine étaient dans le menu, mais que fût ma surprise quand je pouvais créer ma PROPRE POUTINE! Et tse ce n'était pas trop cher. En plus, plusieurs choix de sauces. Si vous êtes végé, il y a même de la sauce  qui n'est pas fait à base de viande! Bref, il y en a pour tous les goûts et pas quelques choix plates...non non! Il y a aussi plusieurs autres choix, mais ça reste de la bouffe de gros! 

Ambiance de resto, on ne va pas là pour prendre pleins de verre, par contre j'étais contente de voir qu'ils offraient de la bière en fût. Je sais qu'ils offrent de Unibroue..je ne me souviens pas par contre ce qu'ils offrent d'autre. Bref, une bonne cheval blanc, ça va très bien avec une poutine! 

Le service était un peu lent, mais sans plus! La serveuse était très très gentille! Bref, bien-sûre que j'y retourne, et chapeau à leur patates maisons, elle sont délicieuses!

Tsé les restos du coin où les petits pains viennent dans un plastique...

Bref, on se comprends...resto ben cute et rapide pour manger très rapidement. La table d'hôte du midi est juste malade 7.95$ +tx pour environs 15 choix et il y a un choix surprise. Une des serveuse m'a dit que c'était de la quésadijâz, un ptit plat mexicain épicé. Mais bref, au milieu de Verdun j'ai décidé de choisir un plat plus authentique de l'endroit, une Pizza-César. Une belle 1\/2 pizza a dress avec ben de la salade pis des petits petis crouton pis de la sauce sans nom. Bref, c'était bon. En plus, vu que c'était en table d'hôte j'ai eu le choix à une soupe maison. La soupe, pour etre sincère était bonne, mais....on dirait que c'était un mélange de 5 soupes différentes...car je ne connais aucune mais aucune soupe dans laquelle on retrouve 5 pâtes différentes (je les ai compté). 

Désolé, j'étais avec ma boss, donc je n'osait pas prndre de photos à table. 

Ahhh pis il y a aussi une autre table d'hôte pour toute la journée : o et bien  c'etait entre 16.95 @ 18.95,  c'était compris la soupe maison, plat principal, café et désert. 

Bref, si jamais tu es dans le coin je te conseil ce petit resto. La clientèle etait plutôt 70 ans et plus par contre. Perso, même si j'ai mis 3* j'y retourne sans hésiter.

Alors,  vu mon horaire occupé...j'ai commandé. Je n'arrivais pas à rentrer sur leur site internet. Alors, j'ai appeler et demandé s'ils avaient des nouilles croustillantes. La reponses...oui et cela venait avec une petite soupe le midi et pour 12$. Comme la livraison minimale était de 15$, j'ai pris des rouleaux. 

Le tout est arrivé en 40 min environs. Je n'ai jamais vu un livreur avec un aussi manque d'hygiène. Désolé, mais c'est ça. Le monsieur ne sentait pas très bon. Il y avait des ongles noirs...(ok il s'est peut etre cogné) mais ses doigts aussi étaient sales. Mais c'est surtout l'odeur du monsieur qui ne m'a pas plus. Bref...j'ai ouvert mon sac...et il manquait la sauce piquante . J'avais aussi demandé un menu...mais il n'était pas là. Le tout 19$ plus tip.

Bref, avec le livreur et le manque de sauce piquante...j'aurai mis 1* . De plus, les nouilles croustillantes étaient tout dans un plat (pas les nouilles séparés) Alors, j'ai mangé cela avant les rouleaux.

The decor is similar, the menu items are similar and the waitresses look similar, except these ones wear more modest pencil skirts, as opposed to the mini skirts that Moxie's favours. 

That said, I don't think I have ever had as good a meal in a Moxie's. 

I was having a HUGE craving for grilled cheese. I couldn't get it out of my head! So I went onto Yelp and typed in grilled cheese and this place came up as being open and not too far away. 

So off we went to the Shops at Don Mills. I've never been to the Shops at Don Mills before, although I have heard of it many times. I'd be interested to come back sometime when stores are open, but in the meantime, into Joey we went. That sounded funny....

Anyway, we ordered calamari appetizer and drinks (beer and a cocktail). The calamari itself was alright, but I really liked the asparagus on top and the aioli. 

Problems arose in terms of the drinks. The waiter recommended the bellini, but then it turned out that the slush machine was umm....slushing. I had to wait until after my meal came to get the bellini, but the waiter was very apologetic and gave regular updates to the progress. It wasn't a huge deal, but I can't help but take points off. When you are paying $60 for two peoples' dinner, you don't really have a choice, right??

My husband ordered a simple caesar salad, which was good, but basic...that's not their fault, that's just what caesars are. I liked the freshly grated parmesan cheese on top though. Better than the powdery stuff that comes from a jar.

Now...my sandwich. I of course ordered their grilled cheese, but this is not any grilled cheese, it is a LOBSTER grilled cheese...oh yes....oh yes....

The bread was buttery and crispy, the cheese perfectly melted and most importantly, it did not overpower the lobster. You could taste the lobster, which was in big chunks in the sandwich. It was delicious. 

The sandwich comes with a large helping of their ""skinny fries"", which are similar to McDonald's fries, but less salty, thank God! 

I NEED to have this grilled cheese again and this place is open late nightly, so good to keep in mind, next time I get a grilled cheese craving. The service is good, prices a little steep, but to be expected in the area. Next time I think I'll order the soup with the sandwich, because I feel like it will work more nicely together. I could be wrong.

Usually we just order delivery and they are quite fast and polite.
I have tried several things from the menu and quite liked them all, although i would avoid anything with bamboo shoots in it. They are tough and sharp!

I went with my sister and husband and we were sat down in the small space. Ethiopian is eaten with your hands, so I went to the bathroom to wash my hands. The bathroom is upstairs where there is another upper part of the restaurant and a small bar. 

The bathroom was clean, although I did notice a cockroach trap in the corner. I want to specify that the washroom was perfectly clean and I never saw any bugs. It was mildly disconcerting, but you'd probably be hard pressed to find any restaurant in downtown without a stray roach SOMEWHERE kicking around in it. Let's just be real!

Anyway, myself and my sister ordered a combo dish of a small portion of all of their veggie options, for two. My husband ordered their ""special"",which was a chicken dish, served with a whole, hard boiled egg.

Our meals arrived and my sister and my meal, was served on a large platter, with spoonfuls of the various dishes all around and a small salad in the middle. Certain parts were better than others, but that's probably a personal preference and nothing was bad. Just good and GOODER (yeah, I KNOW it's not a word).

The prices were also extremely reasonable. The portions of injera (the flat bread you eat the food with) were large and we were given 2 pieces each. That's ALL you would need, but if you're REALLY hungry, the food is served on a large piece of it, so you can literally eat your plate. 

Those are the good things. Now onto the not so good things.

The service was a little lacking. We ordered their special coffee at the beginning of the meal, as requested in the menu, only to be told they were not serving it anymore that day. We were there at around 8:30 and the restaurant closes at 11pm, according to their website. Why was it no longer being served??

Our waitress seemed sort of displeased with us being there in general. She was not very friendly. She avoided eye contact with us most of the night, which made it really hard to get her attention to get the bill and to pay. 

My sister and I were sitting across from each other and when our food was served our injera was on one plate. I asked if I could have another plate, to put my injera on and I got the dirtiest look you could imagine and the waitress turned on her heel without a word. She did get us a plate though. 

Normally, this type of service would be a real turn-off, but honestly the food was so damn good and the prices so damn good, I'm not even going to let it deter me!

YumTum\/ Toronto Underground Market is a food fair. You have to pay a cover and then you have access to various ""vendors\/chefs"" selling food for reasonable prices. So where is the problem? The problem is that it's not a reasonable cost. 

Online the cost is now $22.60\/person PLUS a $2.50 service charge (WTF??!?). So basically you're looking at about $50 for two people...since you're probably not going alone.

Once in, each serving (depending on what it is, costs around $4-$5 on average). You're probably going to want to eat more than two things, since you're there, but lets say you're being cheap and you eat $10 worth of food. Now, for two people, you have spent $70....on a sampling of food, which may be good, but better be dipped in gold for that cost!

Other accounts tell me that this place is sort of turning into another Taste of the Danforth...which used to be awesome...and now it SO crowded, it's totally not enjoyable. So be prepared to wait in lines. 

This event sounds like it has turned into a total racket. Someone is racking in the dough. I would LOVE to support local food vendors and chefs, but it won't be like this. If it was $20 and you got tickets towards vendors of your choice (got to choose 4 samples, for example), or was cheaper, it would make more sense to me. This doesn't feel like it's supporting chefs anymore though. Feels like a money-grab.

Let's see what else...parking is hard to come by...according to Yum Tum's website and so they provide a shuttle bus that runs EVERY THIRTY MINUTES! 

For $70+ I can go and get a nice, sit down dinner with my husband...parking outside the door and that's what I'll be doing this Saturday.

427	GzPQarrGPtszyfZS_5Zkcw	nOTl4aPC4tKHK35T3bNauQ	OlfbvyzbncsZBAMetgPSyQ	4	2012-11-04	"Okay, so this is a review of the THEATRE, not the shows. Both shows I saw were quite good. Avenue Q was a funny, good time and Rocky Horror was EXCELLENT beyond words. Such a blast. 

But I'll keep this review about the actual theatre. People with ""perfect pitch"" below are complaining about the mic problems and I hate to admit that she is not only humble, but correct in this case. There was one small mic problem that last for a couple of seconds in Rocky. 

That said, this is a smaller-scale community theatre, not Mirvish productions. They have small, but passionate casts, performing larger than life productions. Sadly, once and awhile someone's voice gets a little pitchy, or a mic goes out. Since SOME people have such perfect voices, I DO hope they audition for future performances, because if you have perfect pitch, you should really be sharing your gift with the world. *ahem*

Where was I?

RIGHT, the actual THEATRE.

Really, I wish I could be giving this theatre a 3-1\/2 star rating.  The pros - There are no bad seats in the whole place!  Both times I have gone I have had what many people would consider the worst seats in the house. Once right in the front and once right in the back (corner no less).  When you have seats in the front, you are basically ON the stage. The actors come and interact with you and it's tonnes of fun. In the back you can see EVERYTHING and the peoples' reactions. Both seats were good. BUT the physical seats themselves leave something to be desired. THey are literally metal, folding chairs with patio furniture cushions on them. They are set on wooden risers and are very close together with narrow walking paths. 

The other major problem are their bathrooms. I've obviously only seen the women's washroom though. The women's washroom has one two stalls in it, both of which are VERY small. Once you have to squeeze by an old, gross standing shower (?) to get to. The shower's sliding doors are only mostly closed, revealing garbage that has been piled up there...not like food garbage, but old pieces of crap, boxes and stuff. 

Staff have all be helpful and polite when we have gone and it's old and rickety, but works. That said, I feel like a lot of these people performing are local actors\/musicians, just trying to make it, or break into the business and so if the money goes to them, instead of fixing the theatre up a bit, I can understand that.

Neither time I went, did those chairs, or bathrooms take away from the great time I had. Go with a light heart and an open-mind and you will have an excellent time."	2	1	0	['okay', 'review', 'theatr', 'show', 'show', 'saw', 'quit', 'good', 'avenu', 'q', 'funni', 'good', 'time', 'rocki', 'horror', 'excel', 'beyond', 'word', 'blast', 'ill', 'keep', 'review', 'actual', 'theatr', 'peopl', 'perfect', 'pitch', 'complain', 'mic', 'problem', 'hate', 'admit', 'humbl', 'correct', 'case', 'one', 'small', 'mic', 'problem', 'last', 'coupl', 'second', 'rocki', 'said', 'smallerscal', 'commun', 'theatr', 'mirvish', 'product', 'small', 'passion', 'cast', 'perform', 'larger', 'life', 'product', 'sadli', 'awhil', 'someon', 'voic', 'get', 'littl', 'pitchi', 'mic', 'goe', 'sinc', 'peopl', 'perfect', 'voic', 'hope', 'audit', 'futur', 'perform', 'perfect', 'pitch', 'realli', 'share', 'gift', 'world', 'ahemwher', 'iright', 'actual', 'theatrer', 'wish', 'could', 'give', 'theatr', 'star', 'rate', 'pro', 'bad', 'seat', 'whole', 'place', 'time', 'gone', 'mani', 'peopl', 'would', 'consid', 'worst', 'seat', 'hous', 'right', 'front', 'right', 'back', 'corner', 'less', 'seat', 'front', 'basic', 'stage', 'actor', 'come', 'interact', 'tonn', 'fun', 'back', 'see', 'everyth', 'peopl', 'reaction', 'seat', 'good', 'physic', 'seat', 'leav', 'someth', 'desir', 'liter', 'metal', 'fold', 'chair', 'patio', 'furnitur', 'cushion', 'set', 'wooden', 'riser', 'close', 'togeth', 'narrow', 'walk', 'path', 'major', 'problem', 'bathroom', 'ive', 'obvious', 'seen', 'women', 'washroom', 'though', 'women', 'washroom', 'one', 'two', 'stall', 'small', 'squeez', 'old', 'gross', 'stand', 'shower', 'get', 'shower', 'slide', 'door', 'mostli', 'close', 'reveal', 'garbag', 'pile', 'therenot', 'like', 'food', 'garbag', 'old', 'piec', 'crap', 'box', 'stuff', 'staff', 'help', 'polit', 'gone', 'old', 'ricketi', 'work', 'said', 'feel', 'like', 'lot', 'peopl', 'perform', 'local', 'actorsmusician', 'tri', 'make', 'break', 'busi', 'money', 'goe', 'instead', 'fix', 'theatr', 'bit', 'understand', 'thatneith', 'time', 'went', 'chair', 'bathroom', 'take', 'away', 'great', 'time', 'go', 'light', 'heart', 'openmind', 'excel', 'time']

We wanted Lobretto Pizza, but the girl on the phone there said that at 6:30 we wouldn't have a problem getting a table and that turned out to be a lie, so we popped in a couple doors down to this place.

We glanced at the menu and it seemed alright, so we went for it. The host warned us that we needed to like meat and he was not kidding. Everything on the menu had meat.

The menu consists of a lot of pub faire, but at hugely inflated prices. The atmosphere, unlike what you would expect from a ""tavern"" was not dark and cozy, but white and as my friend described ""sort of like a 1950s bathroom"". It had white tile walls and white floors and a sort of mirrored panel across the walls...so yeah a bit bathroom-like. I guess to make it ""saintly""? 

My friend ordered their sandwich of the day, which was a BLT and fries. I have recently given up beef, which limited my choices considerably, so I got the fried chicken. I should mention that the menu includes exactly ZERO explanation of what any of the dishes are. The fried chicken simply says, ""fried chicken"". It did not explain that this came with mashed potatoes and sautéed spinach (or kale??) with it. Potatoes were good, but had big chunks of bacon in them. That should probably be mentioned, since if anyone doesn't eat pork, I don't think it would occur to them to ask the waiter(ess) if their fried chicken includes bacon. 

Food was alright. I liked my friend's sandwich better than my dish and her fries were good.  My meal was exactly as it said. No bells and whistles. I sort of felt like for $20 that chicken should have had some twist to it, or something special, but not really. It was chicken, much like you might receive from KFC, but marginally better (less greasy and salty). 

The spinach was VERY salty tasting. 

Service was good and everyone there was very nice. Overall it's a fine place, but nothing special and I think they charge too much for average food, with nothing special about it. Whenever I go back to the area, I'm going to try something else. I feel like it's not worth a second try, though it was fine for one try."	0	0	1	['friend', 'look', 'place', 'eat', 'show', 'lower', 'ossington', 'theatr', 'want', 'lobretto', 'pizza', 'girl', 'phone', 'said', 'wouldnt', 'problem', 'get', 'tabl', 'turn', 'lie', 'pop', 'coupl', 'door', 'placew', 'glanc', 'menu', 'seem', 'alright', 'went', 'host', 'warn', 'us', 'need', 'like', 'meat', 'kid', 'everyth', 'menu', 'meatth', 'menu', 'consist', 'lot', 'pub', 'fair', 'huge', 'inflat', 'price', 'atmospher', 'unlik', 'would', 'expect', 'tavern', 'dark', 'cozi', 'white', 'friend', 'describ', 'sort', 'like', 'bathroom', 'white', 'tile', 'wall', 'white', 'floor', 'sort', 'mirror', 'panel', 'across', 'wallsso', 'yeah', 'bit', 'bathroomlik', 'guess', 'make', 'saintli', 'friend', 'order', 'sandwich', 'day', 'blt', 'fri', 'recent', 'given', 'beef', 'limit', 'choic', 'consider', 'got', 'fri', 'chicken', 'mention', 'menu', 'includ', 'exactli', 'zero', 'explan', 'dish', 'fri', 'chicken', 'simpli', 'say', 'fri', 'chicken', 'explain', 'came', 'mash', 'potato', 'saut', 'spinach', 'kale', 'potato', 'good', 'big', 'chunk', 'bacon', 'probabl', 'mention', 'sinc', 'anyon', 'doesnt', 'eat', 'pork', 'dont', 'think', 'would', 'occur', 'ask', 'waiteress', 'fri', 'chicken', 'includ', 'bacon', 'food', 'alright', 'like', 'friend', 'sandwich', 'better', 'dish', 'fri', 'good', 'meal', 'exactli', 'said', 'bell', 'whistl', 'sort', 'felt', 'like', 'chicken', 'twist', 'someth', 'special', 'realli', 'chicken', 'much', 'like', 'might', 'receiv', 'kfc', 'margin', 'better', 'less', 'greasi', 'salti', 'spinach', 'salti', 'tast', 'servic', 'good', 'everyon', 'nice', 'overal', 'fine', 'place', 'noth', 'special', 'think', 'charg', 'much', 'averag', 'food', 'noth', 'special', 'whenev', 'go', 'back', 'area', 'im', 'go', 'tri', 'someth', 'els', 'feel', 'like', 'worth', 'second', 'tri', 'though', 'fine', 'one', 'tri']

When we drove up to it I recognized it from driving by, but had never been in. The lineup encouraged me that I was at a good place.

Service was fast and friendly. I got a cheeseburger and onion rings. They gave me a number and when I was called up, I chose what to put on my burger. 

Now, let's get down to the nitty gritty.

First of all, the toppings are VERY limited. Onions or sautéed onions, pickles, tomato, ketchup, mayo, mustard, relish...I didn't even see lettuce, unless it was hiding in the back. 

The burger was large, but nothing special. It wasn't like some fantastic, juicy, seasoned meat or anything. Just a basic burger. 

The bun was too soft and got soggy really fast. I mean SOGGY! It had a weird sweetness to it that I wasn't a huge fan of. The onion rings were your basic frozen onion rings...same with the fries. They weren't hand-battered, or homemade...just standard fare. 

Honestly, NOTHING about this place warranted the rave reviews from my colleagues and the only thing I could glean from hearing them talk, was that this place has been around Scarborough forever and it's just a staple. You go here based on tradition. 

Well, sadly that's not enough of a reason for me to give this a good review. It's also not enough of a reason for me to bother recommending this place. Unless this place has some near and dear meaning in your heart, Hero Burger makes a WAY better burger. I guess if you want your burger made with ""love and memories"" come to this place. I want my burger made with juicy meat, lots of veggies and some sort of mayo-based sauce! If you cannot deliver, I am not interested. Johnny's did not deliver for me on this one!

(PS- If you are the type of person who reads reviews, you'll see one of two camps here...people who love this place based on landmark status and people who haven't been coming here since they were young and therefore are not big fans. Basically THIS ""PS"" could be the review!)"	2	3	0	['inservic', 'area', 'today', 'lunch', 'time', 'roll', 'around', 'colleagu', 'start', 'exclaim', 'johnni', 'never', 'anxiou', 'tri', 'outwhen', 'drove', 'recogn', 'drive', 'never', 'lineup', 'encourag', 'good', 'placeservic', 'fast', 'friendli', 'got', 'cheeseburg', 'onion', 'ring', 'gave', 'number', 'call', 'chose', 'put', 'burger', 'let', 'get', 'nitti', 'grittyfirst', 'top', 'limit', 'onion', 'saut', 'onion', 'pickl', 'tomato', 'ketchup', 'mayo', 'mustard', 'relishi', 'didnt', 'even', 'see', 'lettuc', 'unless', 'hide', 'back', 'burger', 'larg', 'noth', 'special', 'wasnt', 'like', 'fantast', 'juici', 'season', 'meat', 'anyth', 'basic', 'burger', 'bun', 'soft', 'got', 'soggi', 'realli', 'fast', 'mean', 'soggi', 'weird', 'sweet', 'wasnt', 'huge', 'fan', 'onion', 'ring', 'basic', 'frozen', 'onion', 'ringssam', 'fri', 'werent', 'handbatt', 'homemadejust', 'standard', 'fare', 'honestli', 'noth', 'place', 'warrant', 'rave', 'review', 'colleagu', 'thing', 'could', 'glean', 'hear', 'talk', 'place', 'around', 'scarborough', 'forev', 'stapl', 'go', 'base', 'tradit', 'well', 'sadli', 'that', 'enough', 'reason', 'give', 'good', 'review', 'also', 'enough', 'reason', 'bother', 'recommend', 'place', 'unless', 'place', 'near', 'dear', 'mean', 'heart', 'hero', 'burger', 'make', 'way', 'better', 'burger', 'guess', 'want', 'burger', 'made', 'love', 'memori', 'come', 'place', 'want', 'burger', 'made', 'juici', 'meat', 'lot', 'veggi', 'sort', 'mayobas', 'sauc', 'cannot', 'deliv', 'interest', 'johnni', 'deliv', 'onep', 'type', 'person', 'read', 'review', 'youll', 'see', 'one', 'two', 'camp', 'herepeopl', 'love', 'place', 'base', 'landmark', 'statu', 'peopl', 'havent', 'come', 'sinc', 'young', 'therefor', 'big', 'fan', 'basic', 'ps', 'could', 'review']

Perhaps my expectations were high, seeing as this place has been featured on shows and is number one for grilled cheese on BlogTO. 

I had the Grilled Motzy and my husband had the Black Jack. We also had soup, which was tomato and pretty basic. 

Both of our sandwiches were good. I'd say my husband's was a little more sophisticated in taste. Mine felt like the pesto really overwhelmed any other flavours. It wasn't unpleasant, but I WAS wanting a grilled cheese. 

The sandwiches are served in baskets, with some ripple chips and a slice of pickle...really good pickles actually. Chips are just chips. If these guys want to take things up a notch they should charge a dollar or two extra and consider creating a more interesting\/homemade side dish. What??! I don't know, I haven't thought that far ahead. People will pay extra for good and creative side dishes that really add to meals though, right??

Oh and in response to people who were commenting that the sandwiches are really greasy, I didn;t find that at all! There was no grease gathering at the bottom of the paper in the basket and my fingers stayed relatively clean! Maybe they changed?? Or maybe some people are nuts...I mean it IS grilled cheese, it's not ....umm.....lettuce. 

I wasn't willing to leave without trying ONE last item...but we were full. I ordered a sandwich that's name I don't remember, but it was basically cheese, bacon and mushrooms. The to go sandwiches are in plastic boxes with lids. Great if you want to bring it to work the next day, or something.

In our case I split the sandwich in half and served it with my own soup the next day for dinner. This was definitely more of a traditional grilled cheese, but again, I found the bacon to be a little overpowering. Still good...my soup was heads and tails better though. 

Not sure I would bother with the soup here again. I liked everything I had, but nothing compared with the lobster grilled cheese I had the Joey's. The flavours were perfect in that sandwich!

THere are a lot of other options to try and everything was very good. I think that if you're in the area and want a sandwich that costs the same as Subway, but is more creative and more delicious, this is a great choice! 

Oh....they only take cash BTW!

As a diner, it's food was perfectly acceptable and actually very good. The service was excellent! Prices were decent. I don't know what else you need!

I came for lunch with a ground of friends. We wanted drinks, we wanted food, some wanted breakfast food (they have all day breakfast...also awesome) and this fit the bill perfectly. 

Our waitress was very sweet and accommodating and fast with the food and drinks. She split up all our bills for us, with no problem (so many places it's like the biggest deal ever). 

Everyone enjoyed their food and we certainly got a variety of it. All large portions. Drinks were good, so no complaints there! 

The atmosphere is...well let's call it quaint. It has some dated decor and paintings on the wall of a sort of olden-days train station. It's a diner, so it is what it is!

Only criticism of this place is that it only takes cash. They have an ATM in the front, but be prepared.

They are very willing to let you try out pieces of their baked goods and you will not be disappointed. I ended up going twice in two days. The first time on the recommendation I picked up a few cookies. They were so good that the next day when I had to go back to the area to return something, I went back again and got some other stuff.

Senor Frogs fit the bill pretty well. Although we came just as a torrential downpour occurred, which pushed us from the patio, to the bar to finish eating, the food and service were quite good and the prices reasonable (for Vegas standards). BUT, while we were there there was some sort of singer\/karaoke going on. I'm thinking a mixture of the two because we heard one girls' voice for several songs, but every once and awhile some obviously amateur's voice would ring out ""I'm too Sexy"" or a Spice Girl song.
Problems: First of all, I did NOT sign up for karaoke. We sat AWAY from all of that to avoid it, but the problem was that they have speakers over all the tables, regardless of where you are and they were LOUD! Secondly, the woman singing, who, from what we could gauge over the speakers, worked here, was NOT a good singer. It was like listening to one of those American Idol auditions, where the person thinks they're great, but just sort of yells the song out and no one can be bothered to tell them they suck, because they're not nails on a chalkboard, but they're still not good either.
Sadly, we had to listen to this, even though we were in a totally different room!

This weird little nook, way down on Sheppard, is barely noticeable if you drive by. I've gotten their take out a few times and also eaten in once. 

I've had their chicken shwarma and falafel pitas and sampled some other dishes. Generally, I find the portions quite large and the food quite good, but it's a bit of a crap shoot with the chicken shwarma. I've had it a couple of times where it has been very good and another time I thought the meat was chewy, fatty and full of gristle. It's being cut off of a big hunk on a spit, so I guess you get whatever comes off at that time. 

The service has always been great and very pleasant."	1	1	0	['sort', 'want', 'give', 'place', 'star', 'oh', 'well', 'weird', 'littl', 'nook', 'way', 'sheppard', 'bare', 'notic', 'drive', 'ive', 'gotten', 'take', 'time', 'also', 'eaten', 'ive', 'chicken', 'shwarma', 'falafel', 'pita', 'sampl', 'dish', 'gener', 'find', 'portion', 'quit', 'larg', 'food', 'quit', 'good', 'bit', 'crap', 'shoot', 'chicken', 'shwarma', 'ive', 'coupl', 'time', 'good', 'anoth', 'time', 'thought', 'meat', 'chewi', 'fatti', 'full', 'gristl', 'cut', 'big', 'hunk', 'spit', 'guess', 'get', 'whatev', 'come', 'time', 'servic', 'alway', 'great', 'pleasant']

This is a chain that I actually first ate at while in Florida. I didn't even know they had made their way to Canada, but we were excited to see it and turned the car around to see how things went here in Canada.

The burgers are good, very large and filling and I like the grilled mushrooms as a topping. Where they fall short: no specialty sauces (just basic mayo) and no combos! This I find very strange. You have to order everything separately. It seems like a little thing to make a combo!

I liked the service though. The woman taking our order told me that only one fry would work or two people and she was right. I appreciated the heads up! But I wish they had some more variety of products.

I'm comparing it to the obvious one: Hero Burger and I guess what I'm saying is, Hero Burger wins! 

BUT if you want a good, basic burger, this is a good choice.

I switched jobs and stopped working close by and didn't come back for years. I'm not kidding, I was always sad about that. It just wasn't close! 

Well, I happened to be in the area a few nights ago and of course, it only made sense to go back. It was exactly as I remembered it....AMAZING! The food is SO excellent here and the service is just amazingly quick. We got our food in I'd say under five minutes! Our water glasses were always full and the portions are so large, you can easily make one meal stretch to two. Just thinking about it right now makes me want to go back! 

So why the loss of one star? 

Well...this is a tricky one. You see, the service was great, BUT there was probably one of the rudest and most annoying families I have ever encountered at a restaurant in my life...other than the time I was eating at a Kelsey's and a kid was literally running circles around the restaurant screaming and when I quietly asked the parents if they could quiet their child the dad told me to f-off, in front of his three year old...because they were celebrating a ""religious occasion""....right, where was I? Yes, so this family was divided so that the approx 2 year old was sitting farthest away from all parents, in a booster seat and shouting and screeching loudly, while banging a spoon against the table. The other two yong boys, who appeared to be acting as the caregivers, where egging him on, trying to make him scream louder. The waiter took care of the spoon, by quietly taking away the metal one and replacing it with a plastic one, but the kid kept shouting.

Now, I want to be clear. I don't blame the restaurant for bad parenting. I understand that this is a tricky situation. You don't want to single out any of your guests and lose business. But here's the thing. There were four adults there that you might lose business from, vs. the other 10-12 adults you very well could lose business from, because people were visibly upset with this kid and his parents. 

The other thing is that there was an easy solution. Half of the restaurant, on the other side of the building, was not being used, simply because there were not enough patrons to require it. Having a waiter approach the family and politely offer them a table in that room, as it would allow their child to continue being a bit nosier, would both get rid of them AND probably show them that they need to control their terrible offspring. 

As it was, nothing was resolved and we did not stick around for dessert. As we were leaving, a man sitting across from the family was looking like he might burst into flames. I asked if it was annoying enough for him and he shock his head and loudly said, ""I'm going to f-ing LOSE it."" So yeah...may want to take care of that situation. Having your patrons enjoy their time is SO important to their experience. 

OH! And if you're a family with kids, everyone knows that kids make noise and can be rambunctious at times...it's still your job to ensure they are being polite. People managed to have their children be polite in public for hundreds of years. Surely it's not impossible in the year 2012. A good start would be to sit WITH them."	3	4	3	['work', 'area', 'would', 'treat', 'everi', 'week', 'two', 'go', 'lunch', 'gorg', 'switch', 'job', 'stop', 'work', 'close', 'didnt', 'come', 'back', 'year', 'im', 'kid', 'alway', 'sad', 'wasnt', 'close', 'well', 'happen', 'area', 'night', 'ago', 'cours', 'made', 'sens', 'go', 'back', 'exactli', 'rememb', 'itamaz', 'food', 'excel', 'servic', 'amazingli', 'quick', 'got', 'food', 'id', 'say', 'five', 'minut', 'water', 'glass', 'alway', 'full', 'portion', 'larg', 'easili', 'make', 'one', 'meal', 'stretch', 'two', 'think', 'right', 'make', 'want', 'go', 'back', 'loss', 'one', 'star', 'wellthi', 'tricki', 'one', 'see', 'servic', 'great', 'probabl', 'one', 'rudest', 'annoy', 'famili', 'ever', 'encount', 'restaur', 'lifeoth', 'time', 'eat', 'kelsey', 'kid', 'liter', 'run', 'circl', 'around', 'restaur', 'scream', 'quietli', 'ask', 'parent', 'could', 'quiet', 'child', 'dad', 'told', 'foff', 'front', 'three', 'year', 'oldbecaus', 'celebr', 'religi', 'occasionright', 'ye', 'famili', 'divid', 'approx', 'year', 'old', 'sit', 'farthest', 'away', 'parent', 'booster', 'seat', 'shout', 'screech', 'loudli', 'bang', 'spoon', 'tabl', 'two', 'yong', 'boy', 'appear', 'act', 'caregiv', 'eg', 'tri', 'make', 'scream', 'louder', 'waiter', 'took', 'care', 'spoon', 'quietli', 'take', 'away', 'metal', 'one', 'replac', 'plastic', 'one', 'kid', 'kept', 'shoutingnow', 'want', 'clear', 'dont', 'blame', 'restaur', 'bad', 'parent', 'understand', 'tricki', 'situat', 'dont', 'want', 'singl', 'guest', 'lose', 'busi', 'here', 'thing', 'four', 'adult', 'might', 'lose', 'busi', 'vs', 'adult', 'well', 'could', 'lose', 'busi', 'peopl', 'visibl', 'upset', 'kid', 'parent', 'thing', 'easi', 'solut', 'half', 'restaur', 'side', 'build', 'use', 'simpli', 'enough', 'patron', 'requir', 'waiter', 'approach', 'famili', 'polit', 'offer', 'tabl', 'room', 'would', 'allow', 'child', 'continu', 'bit', 'nosier', 'would', 'get', 'rid', 'probabl', 'show', 'need', 'control', 'terribl', 'offspr', 'noth', 'resolv', 'stick', 'around', 'dessert', 'leav', 'man', 'sit', 'across', 'famili', 'look', 'like', 'might', 'burst', 'flame', 'ask', 'annoy', 'enough', 'shock', 'head', 'loudli', 'said', 'im', 'go', 'fing', 'lose', 'yeahmay', 'want', 'take', 'care', 'situat', 'patron', 'enjoy', 'time', 'import', 'experi', 'oh', 'your', 'famili', 'kid', 'everyon', 'know', 'kid', 'make', 'nois', 'rambuncti', 'timesit', 'still', 'job', 'ensur', 'polit', 'peopl', 'manag', 'children', 'polit', 'public', 'hundr', 'year', 'sure', 'imposs', 'year', 'good', 'start', 'would', 'sit']

I had tiger shrimp as an appetizer. It came with a delicious peanut sauce. This was the same for the chicken. They were actually very good. My sister had spring rolls and she said they were alright, nothing special. We all got pad thai, however my sister got the vegetarian pad thai, while myself and my husband got the chicken pad thai. It was good, but pretty comparable to pad thai I've had....well, just about everywhere. The desserts were also alright. There was a special on drinks. Their signature Tiger beers were only $4 and they had excellent margaritas for $6. That was probably my favorite part of the meal. The service was good and the atmosphere was nice, but overall I felt like the food wasn't special enough to warrant the $25 price tag.	0	0	0	['went', 'summerlici', 'got', 'appet', 'main', 'cours', 'dessert', 'tiger', 'shrimp', 'appet', 'came', 'delici', 'peanut', 'sauc', 'chicken', 'actual', 'good', 'sister', 'spring', 'roll', 'said', 'alright', 'noth', 'special', 'got', 'pad', 'thai', 'howev', 'sister', 'got', 'vegetarian', 'pad', 'thai', 'husband', 'got', 'chicken', 'pad', 'thai', 'good', 'pretti', 'compar', 'pad', 'thai', 'ive', 'hadwel', 'everywher', 'dessert', 'also', 'alright', 'special', 'drink', 'signatur', 'tiger', 'beer', 'excel', 'margarita', 'probabl', 'favorit', 'part', 'meal', 'servic', 'good', 'atmospher', 'nice', 'overal', 'felt', 'like', 'food', 'wasnt', 'special', 'enough', 'warrant', 'price', 'tag']

So I have been hearing about Pizzeria Libretto for ages and dying to try it and I finally got my chance. We went all out, so I'll go through the stuff I sampled.

We shared an arugula salad with walnuts and pears. Not a huge salad, given the $9 price tag, but was a really good salad. We also tried the ricotta gnocchi fritti. This was disappointing. They basically looked and tasted like tator tots with a sour cream and chive ""sauce"". I don't know where the ricotta comes into play, but these were nothing special, a small portion and not great in general. 

NOW for the reason people come to this place. The pizzas. I had the Libretto Margherita (which is $4 more than the regular margherita, presumably because they use buffalo mozzarella, or so it is alluded to on the menu). My husband got the house-made sausage pizza.

These pizzas were excellent. Both reminiscent of what you might find in Italy, very thin, but with perfect crust. I usually go with the margherita, because it's classic and not too many bells and whistles, but I had a piece of my husband's and it was excellent! I'm not usually a sausage fan (no pun intended), but this was really good. 

Finally, we split their sfingi, which is basically donut holes in cinnamon-sugar and with a strawberry sauce, caramel sauce or lemon sauce to dip them in. The donuts were nothing special. Honestly, I've had better at Tim Horton's. The sauces added a little something, but not enough to make this something I would order again. The lemon was good, husband liked the strawberry...the caramel, which you would think would be great with donuts, tasted burnt...to the point where it was inedible. 

So basically, if you come for the pizza, you're good to go. This place does that really well..everything else...skip it. There are so many awesome little places in the area, I would just get the pizza and go get dessert somewhere else. 

That said, because this place IS a pizzeria, I give it 4 stars, because they do the thing they're supposed to, well!"	0	1	0	['realli', 'deserv', 'star', 'rate', 'well', 'go', 'ill', 'explainso', 'hear', 'pizzeria', 'libretto', 'age', 'die', 'tri', 'final', 'got', 'chanc', 'went', 'ill', 'go', 'stuff', 'sampledw', 'share', 'arugula', 'salad', 'walnut', 'pear', 'huge', 'salad', 'given', 'price', 'tag', 'realli', 'good', 'salad', 'also', 'tri', 'ricotta', 'gnocchi', 'fritti', 'disappoint', 'basic', 'look', 'tast', 'like', 'tator', 'tot', 'sour', 'cream', 'chive', 'sauc', 'dont', 'know', 'ricotta', 'come', 'play', 'noth', 'special', 'small', 'portion', 'great', 'gener', 'reason', 'peopl', 'come', 'place', 'pizza', 'libretto', 'margherita', 'regular', 'margherita', 'presum', 'use', 'buffalo', 'mozzarella', 'allud', 'menu', 'husband', 'got', 'housemad', 'sausag', 'pizzathes', 'pizza', 'excel', 'reminisc', 'might', 'find', 'itali', 'thin', 'perfect', 'crust', 'usual', 'go', 'margherita', 'classic', 'mani', 'bell', 'whistl', 'piec', 'husband', 'excel', 'im', 'usual', 'sausag', 'fan', 'pun', 'intend', 'realli', 'good', 'final', 'split', 'sfingi', 'basic', 'donut', 'hole', 'cinnamonsugar', 'strawberri', 'sauc', 'caramel', 'sauc', 'lemon', 'sauc', 'dip', 'donut', 'noth', 'special', 'honestli', 'ive', 'better', 'tim', 'horton', 'sauc', 'ad', 'littl', 'someth', 'enough', 'make', 'someth', 'would', 'order', 'lemon', 'good', 'husband', 'like', 'strawberryth', 'caramel', 'would', 'think', 'would', 'great', 'donut', 'tast', 'burntto', 'point', 'ined', 'basic', 'come', 'pizza', 'your', 'good', 'go', 'place', 'realli', 'welleveryth', 'elseskip', 'mani', 'awesom', 'littl', 'place', 'area', 'would', 'get', 'pizza', 'go', 'get', 'dessert', 'somewher', 'els', 'said', 'place', 'pizzeria', 'give', 'star', 'thing', 'theyr', 'suppos', 'well']

Problem is that they close at 4pm on weekdays, which is very inconvenient for basically most employed people. I guess that's criticism number 1!

Still, I vowed I would try those bagels. I had heard such good things. I wondered if all my life I was merely eating bread, and not experiencing true bagel deliciousness! 

Finally, I made a special trip, on the weekend to Bagel World JUST for those bagels...and what a disappointment. We got four bagels: 2 plain and 2 ""everything"". We sampled the plain one first...they were bland and tasteless, with no crispness on the outside and softness on the inside, like I have come to expect from a good bagel. They were basically just huge hunks of dough. They were expensive, although large, but I didn't finish mine. I nibbled the everything bagel and was equally disappointed. In the end I had to throw them out. They sat there on my counter for days, before it finally became clear that no matter how hungry I got, I wasn't going to bother.

SO what happened? A bad batch? Maybe I hyped them up too much? Who knows! All I know is that I can't figure out where the rav reviews come from. I wanted to like them so badly...and they were just bleh.

It was a Friday at lunch, so we got their fish and chip special. It took quite awhile to bring them all out, but basically all of us ordered it, so that may have been the reason. The meal ended up being very well priced (cheaper than what was listed on their website. Not sure if that's because it was lunch, or because it's just cheaper than what they have listed). Food was good and the portions were large. The waiter was very pleasant the the pub itself had a good atmosphere.

This cafe, which appears quite new, is a great alternative to Starbucks. 

Close your mouths, I know I just committed a crime (ALTERNATIVE to STARBUCKS??!?!) I LOVE Starbucks, but you know every time you go there, there are never any seats, because I swear, they hire people to sit there from 7am till 11pm on their Macbooks. 

Anyway, this place has no lack of seating. THere are several levels of pretty, clean white tables and booths, with comfy, modern, grey chairs.

In-between the booths are walls, which are mirrored, but have TVs in them as well...built into them! They look all futuristic and crap! 

Of course their are tributes to Ms. Monroe, but they're not slapping you in the face and you can certainly go here without feeling like you need to be obsessed. 

The menu for drinks is similar to what you find at Starbucks...they have cafe mochas and creme brule lattes and caramel lattes, etc. I didn't find their drinks quite as good as Starbucks' though. They were good, don't get me wrong, but Starbucks drinks really are above and beyond....SOOO minus one star.

BUT they have the cafe portion, which serves some cheesecakes and cupcakes and the like. I really enjoyed my cupcake actually, even though it was pretty pricey. The cakes look good, but the portions are pretty small, given the prices. It would be nice if they served more savory treats as well. I hadn't had lunch, so I ordered a bagel with cream cheese and I was given a good bagel, but packets of cream cheese...that's sort of chintzy in a place which looks as classy...sorry if I can't even get the same service in bagels as Tim Horton's??! Come on now! 

The service was polite, but a little slow and my friend commented that she had some questions about their tea selection (whether the herbal teas were caffeinated or not) and the girl working their had no idea. 

SOOO even though I really liked this place and would totally come back for a treat (great place if you want to sit and chat over coffee), it loses that one star.

That said, if you want a fun treat place and would enjoy a nice place to sit, this is a great option in Oakville!"	3	0	0	['fun', 'fantast', 'littl', 'find', 'downtown', 'oakvil', 'cafe', 'appear', 'quit', 'new', 'great', 'altern', 'starbuck', 'close', 'mouth', 'know', 'commit', 'crime', 'altern', 'starbuck', 'love', 'starbuck', 'know', 'everi', 'time', 'go', 'never', 'seat', 'swear', 'hire', 'peopl', 'sit', 'till', 'pm', 'macbook', 'anyway', 'place', 'lack', 'seat', 'sever', 'level', 'pretti', 'clean', 'white', 'tabl', 'booth', 'comfi', 'modern', 'grey', 'chairsinbetween', 'booth', 'wall', 'mirror', 'tv', 'wellbuilt', 'look', 'futurist', 'crap', 'cours', 'tribut', 'ms', 'monro', 'theyr', 'slap', 'face', 'certainli', 'go', 'without', 'feel', 'like', 'need', 'obsess', 'menu', 'drink', 'similar', 'find', 'starbucksthey', 'cafe', 'mocha', 'creme', 'brule', 'latt', 'caramel', 'latt', 'etc', 'didnt', 'find', 'drink', 'quit', 'good', 'starbuck', 'though', 'good', 'dont', 'get', 'wrong', 'starbuck', 'drink', 'realli', 'beyondsooo', 'minu', 'one', 'starbut', 'cafe', 'portion', 'serv', 'cheesecak', 'cupcak', 'like', 'realli', 'enjoy', 'cupcak', 'actual', 'even', 'though', 'pretti', 'pricey', 'cake', 'look', 'good', 'portion', 'pretti', 'small', 'given', 'price', 'would', 'nice', 'serv', 'savori', 'treat', 'well', 'hadnt', 'lunch', 'order', 'bagel', 'cream', 'chees', 'given', 'good', 'bagel', 'packet', 'cream', 'cheesethat', 'sort', 'chintzi', 'place', 'look', 'classysorri', 'cant', 'even', 'get', 'servic', 'bagel', 'tim', 'horton', 'come', 'servic', 'polit', 'littl', 'slow', 'friend', 'comment', 'question', 'tea', 'select', 'whether', 'herbal', 'tea', 'caffein', 'girl', 'work', 'idea', 'sooo', 'even', 'though', 'realli', 'like', 'place', 'would', 'total', 'come', 'back', 'treat', 'great', 'place', 'want', 'sit', 'chat', 'coffe', 'lose', 'one', 'starthat', 'said', 'want', 'fun', 'treat', 'place', 'would', 'enjoy', 'nice', 'place', 'sit', 'great', 'option', 'oakvil']

This is because in the past I have been going to places, been pretty pleased, written stellar reviews and then gone back and been less than pleased...and having to awkwardly revise those great reviews. 

I have been to a few different locations of Civello before and been quite happy, but I have found it to be on the expensive side and it's also a bit out of the way for me, so that led me to begin the search for another place. I did get my wedding hair and makeup done there though and was very happy. 

But let's move onto NOW. Here's the thing: If you want quality, you MAY have to pay a bit more. Now that I've gone all over Toronto searching for a hair salon, I actually don't find Civello to be that expensive. I mean, consider that you are stuck wearing your hair every day of your life, right? If you had to wear the same pair of jeans every day for 3-4 months, would you buy the $40 pair, or the $200 pair? EXACTLY! Except it's really not crazy expensive and I don't know where I got that idea from exactly....

Okay, so I'm getting off topic.

I went to Civello the first time (since I got my hair styled three years ago for my wedding) at the beginning of the summer. Now there are LOTS of people that work at Civello, so I almost don't want to say who I went with, because I'm worried that everyone is going to start flocking to Civello and demanding this one stylist and I'll never be able to get an appointment ever again (yes, yes, #firstworldproblems). But it wouldn't be fair to him, to not say and it's maybe a little silly to think my yelp review has so much influence on the Toronto community. So yeah, they put me with Byron. 

I feel so selfless!

I had some crappy pictures of what I wanted on my phone, but he worked with them and me. In the end it was gorgeous. Seriously, I wish I had taken pictures it was so pretty.

Approx 4 months later and I'm back again, this time with a few adjustments in mind. 

Once again, I think my hair looks great. 

Besides quality hair, Civello is quick to offer coffee, tea or water. They also give lovely back massages while your hair is setting. Or Byron was getting fresh. Who's to say?

Everyone there is really lovely, but Byron may be one of the better hairdressers I have had. Conversation feels more natural and he has some sort of weird, superpower memory for people, which is both amazing and unsettling. Either way it makes conversation a pleasure. And of course he does hair well, which is why we go to hair salons at the end of the day. Life isn't REALLY like Steel Magnolias...thank God. 

I'm starting to feel weird, like I'm creating some creepy fan club, so I'll just leave it at that.

When I went to Italy I was expecting all of the food to be as good as, if not better than what I had at Alegno. Well, if we were lucky, it was as good. Which means I'm guessing this as good as it gets! The food truly is exceptional! 

We went again last weekend and ordered the special, which was amazing as always. We were very hungry, but they gave us two baskets of bread, no problem. One of the nicest things was that I ordered amaretto and ginerale. They brought them out separately and I had to add them together, but they kept bringing me refills of my ginerale. By the end my drink obviously had no more alcohol, but I thought it was so nice that they felt they should refill my drink all the same. 

It's a small place and entirely family run, so the service is sometimes slow and they will sometimes run out of specials, because I guess they make only so many\/night, but that just proves the family-run business atmosphere and the homemade food.

I was sort of expecting a situation were we could design our own cookies and take half a dozen home to enjoy later. But I was informed that the personalized cookies are really best if you have them within an hour of baking them. I'm assuming that then they start going stale. They have regular cookies, but their selection was very limited that evening and we decided to try the thing I'm assuming they're known for. 

My husband ordered oatmeal, with chocolate chunks and m&ms. I ordered peanut butter with toffee and chocolate chips. We waited the couple of minutes for our cookies and got them to go. 

My husband's cookie was not particularly good. It was bland and dry. Tasted off. Mine was much better, but crumbled very easily, like nothing was holding it together. Basically, when you have a cookie that can cook in two minutes, you're sacrificing some rather important elements that make up great cookies. For $2.75\/cookie, I'm not sure it's worth it.

That said, the regular cookies, although not unique, looked good and I want to give this place the benefit of the doubt. I truly believe they CAN make a good cookie and my cookie tasted quite good. I think I would have rather waited for a bit longer and gotten proper cookies though, myself. 

If you go, avoid the oatmeal dough.  

Wouldn't mind going back some time to try a regular cookie or a muffin top."	1	0	0	['dinner', 'want', 'dessert', 'walk', 'place', 'tri', 'sort', 'expect', 'situat', 'could', 'design', 'cooki', 'take', 'half', 'dozen', 'home', 'enjoy', 'later', 'inform', 'person', 'cooki', 'realli', 'best', 'within', 'hour', 'bake', 'im', 'assum', 'start', 'go', 'stale', 'regular', 'cooki', 'select', 'limit', 'even', 'decid', 'tri', 'thing', 'im', 'assum', 'theyr', 'known', 'husband', 'order', 'oatmeal', 'chocol', 'chunk', 'mm', 'order', 'peanut', 'butter', 'toffe', 'chocol', 'chip', 'wait', 'coupl', 'minut', 'cooki', 'got', 'go', 'husband', 'cooki', 'particularli', 'good', 'bland', 'dri', 'tast', 'mine', 'much', 'better', 'crumbl', 'easili', 'like', 'noth', 'hold', 'togeth', 'basic', 'cooki', 'cook', 'two', 'minut', 'your', 'sacrif', 'rather', 'import', 'element', 'make', 'great', 'cooki', 'cooki', 'im', 'sure', 'worth', 'itthat', 'said', 'regular', 'cooki', 'although', 'uniqu', 'look', 'good', 'want', 'give', 'place', 'benefit', 'doubt', 'truli', 'believ', 'make', 'good', 'cooki', 'cooki', 'tast', 'quit', 'good', 'think', 'would', 'rather', 'wait', 'bit', 'longer', 'gotten', 'proper', 'cooki', 'though', 'go', 'avoid', 'oatmeal', 'dough', 'wouldnt', 'mind', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'tri', 'regular', 'cooki', 'muffin', 'top']

We went with Priceline to get our hotel and were reasonably pleased with getting the Delta Centre-Ville as the hotel we ended up bidding on. It's a pretty good location and an okay price for a 3-1\/2 star hotel in Montreal (from what we were finding were normal prices). We paid around $125 a night, if I remember correctly. However, take into account that parking is around $25 extra per night, so really you're looking at $150\/night...so it's not cheap and I was expecting 3-1\/2 star quality. I did NOT get that.

The lobby looked pretty promising, clean and modern looking, but our room certainly doesn't look like any of those pictures you see on the travel sites. 

The furniture was old and worn. The curtains were also worn and one had a hole in it that looked like it had been burned with a cigarette. The bathroom was very dated. The mirror was all that fake, gold brass, with lightbulbs that got really hot and there was no fan! There was also a single hook in the whole bathroom to hang towels on. Not even a towel holder, just one hook. The wallpaper was old and peeling in places. 

The floor, where the door opened, was ripped and missing chunks. The bedding was old and dingy. There was TONNES of mold on the ceiling where the A\/C vent was. 

In retrospect, we should have complained, but it wasn't so bad we couldn't sleep there, so we made due. 

All this even would have been fine. I would have given it two, maybe even three stars (if I was feeling generous), except for what happened AFTER we checked out.

My sister had put the room on her credit card and she noticed a $100 charge from the hotel on her card when she got home. Since we had gone through Priceline, you pay in advance, so we had already paid for the room. She called up the hotel to ask about the strange charge. 

The girl she spoke with told her that this was a sort of ""downpayment"" that they charge when you check in and assuming you don't make any charges, they reimburse you. So far fine, right? Except this was not explained politely. The girl was very rude and curt in explaining. No one had mentioned this when we checked in and my sister said so. The girl then told my sister that, ""If you ever travelled, then you would KNOW about this sort of thing, because EVERY hotel does it...Are you happy?"" 

My sister was shocked by this response and just said yes and hung up. Then, regaining her bearings and realizing how rude the exchange had been, called back and asked to speak with a manager. She explained to the manager how she had been treated over the phone and the manager said she would speak to the girl. Obviously we have no idea if this happened, or how it was dealt with.

The fact is that 1) We actually travel quite a bit and NO actually Hotel Girl, other hotels do NOT charge you randomly, for no reason and 2) What if we didn't travel often?? How rude to throw it in our faces, as though this is something that any idiot should know, when it hadn't been explained. 

So you know what....I can take the crappy room and old, dingy decor...but I can't take the hotel staff being blatantly rude and obnoxious. I would not recommend this place."	1	1	0	['sister', 'decid', 'spend', 'long', 'weekend', 'montreal', 'went', 'pricelin', 'get', 'hotel', 'reason', 'pleas', 'get', 'delta', 'centrevil', 'hotel', 'end', 'bid', 'pretti', 'good', 'locat', 'okay', 'price', 'star', 'hotel', 'montreal', 'find', 'normal', 'price', 'paid', 'around', 'night', 'rememb', 'correctli', 'howev', 'take', 'account', 'park', 'around', 'extra', 'per', 'night', 'realli', 'your', 'look', 'nightso', 'cheap', 'expect', 'star', 'qualiti', 'get', 'thatth', 'lobbi', 'look', 'pretti', 'promis', 'clean', 'modern', 'look', 'room', 'certainli', 'doesnt', 'look', 'like', 'pictur', 'see', 'travel', 'site', 'furnitur', 'old', 'worn', 'curtain', 'also', 'worn', 'one', 'hole', 'look', 'like', 'burn', 'cigarett', 'bathroom', 'date', 'mirror', 'fake', 'gold', 'brass', 'lightbulb', 'got', 'realli', 'hot', 'fan', 'also', 'singl', 'hook', 'whole', 'bathroom', 'hang', 'towel', 'even', 'towel', 'holder', 'one', 'hook', 'wallpap', 'old', 'peel', 'place', 'floor', 'door', 'open', 'rip', 'miss', 'chunk', 'bed', 'old', 'dingi', 'tonn', 'mold', 'ceil', 'ac', 'vent', 'retrospect', 'complain', 'wasnt', 'bad', 'couldnt', 'sleep', 'made', 'due', 'even', 'would', 'fine', 'would', 'given', 'two', 'mayb', 'even', 'three', 'star', 'feel', 'gener', 'except', 'happen', 'check', 'outmi', 'sister', 'put', 'room', 'credit', 'card', 'notic', 'charg', 'hotel', 'card', 'got', 'home', 'sinc', 'gone', 'pricelin', 'pay', 'advanc', 'alreadi', 'paid', 'room', 'call', 'hotel', 'ask', 'strang', 'charg', 'girl', 'spoke', 'told', 'sort', 'downpay', 'charg', 'check', 'assum', 'dont', 'make', 'charg', 'reimburs', 'far', 'fine', 'right', 'except', 'explain', 'polit', 'girl', 'rude', 'curt', 'explain', 'one', 'mention', 'check', 'sister', 'said', 'girl', 'told', 'sister', 'ever', 'travel', 'would', 'know', 'sort', 'thing', 'everi', 'hotel', 'itar', 'happi', 'sister', 'shock', 'respons', 'said', 'ye', 'hung', 'regain', 'bear', 'realiz', 'rude', 'exchang', 'call', 'back', 'ask', 'speak', 'manag', 'explain', 'manag', 'treat', 'phone', 'manag', 'said', 'would', 'speak', 'girl', 'obvious', 'idea', 'happen', 'dealt', 'withth', 'fact', 'actual', 'travel', 'quit', 'bit', 'actual', 'hotel', 'girl', 'hotel', 'charg', 'randomli', 'reason', 'didnt', 'travel', 'often', 'rude', 'throw', 'face', 'though', 'someth', 'idiot', 'know', 'hadnt', 'explain', 'know', 'whati', 'take', 'crappi', 'room', 'old', 'dingi', 'decorbut', 'cant', 'take', 'hotel', 'staff', 'blatantli', 'rude', 'obnoxi', 'would', 'recommend', 'place']

I had a craving for Italian and I had gotten home late and didn't want to spend a lot at a sit down, so we looked this place up and make the trek to check it out.

I actually love the place..it's a total hole in the wall, that has clearly been there for ages. It's a converted house, next to a garage. When you walk inside it looks a bit like a kitchen, with a bunch of tables. The walls are covered in airbrushed Italian scenes and there is a sort of bar to the side, where you place your order.

The menu is quite limited though and I was disappointed that there is not a single pasta dish. Instead this place seems to specialize in sandwiches. 

The gentleman who owns the place and makes the food was really the highlight of this place and would be the reason I would keep coming back. He is sweet and cheerful and kind and was quick to offer us samples to try. 

I ordered eggplant parmesan and my husband ordered a veal sandwich. Everything was fine, although nothing special. My husband ordered a caesar salad and the bacon bits were the sort of fake, packaged kind an the muchrooms for the sandwich were from a can. 

So yes, this food IS made with love, because this gentleman who runs the place is lovely and has a true pride in his food. And the prices are extremely low. But it's still not the best quality and the taste suffers from it.

THAT said, you are not going to find such a large, veal sandwich for as cheap.

For these reasons I sort of equate this place to an Italian Subway sandwich shop. That's not a bad thing! The quality is on par with a fast food sandwich place and the prices are low. You know you ALL eat at Subway from time to time, when you just need a quick sandwich.

I went with my loud, boisterous family\/friends. There were 8 of us in total. 

The last time I went to Medieval Time was in grade 4, so what better time to go, than for your 30th birthday. We bought drinks in advance. Drink prices were average for a bar, although the mixed drinks were particularly delicious. The cups are kind of fun and you can keep them. The whole place reminded me of something you would find in Vegas, with the whole entrance room decorated with medieval flags and armour. 

We were finally called in for dinner. Now, I want to preface this by saying that dinner is nothing special. You kind of go for the whole, goofy experience, not really the fine cuisine. You get tomato bisque, garlic bread, half of a chicken, a few potato wedges and a small thing of ribs and then an apple pastry for dessert. Everything is served separately, not all together, so you're eating everything one at a time. They are served to you by your ""wenches"". That said, while nothing was particularly impressive, nothing was bad either. You don't get cutlery, so you pick at everything with your fingers. However, they give you wetnaps and a hot towel at the end. My sister ordered the vegetarian meal and they gave her a veggie shish-kabob, which she said was quite good. 

Drinks are water or pepsi, or the drinks you order at the bar.

Now, onto the show. We cheered and yelled like crazy people the entire time. We picked fights with other ""teams"" (people cheering for other knights) and they picked fights back. We laughed and cheered and jeered at the knights. The show consists of some horse tricks, a falcon flying over you and of course the knights battling. Everything is exceedingly cheesy and you just have to enjoy it for what it is. 

Anyway, this was a cheesy, good time. I would do this again in an instant...but only with the right crowd.

PS - Our knight won! We think it was because we cheered loudest."	1	1	0	['go', 'someth', 'like', 'mediev', 'time', 'openmind', 'sens', 'fun', 'also', 'go', 'group', 'isnt', 'even', 'someth', 'couplealthough', 'see', 'happen', 'went', 'loud', 'boister', 'familyfriend', 'us', 'total', 'last', 'time', 'went', 'mediev', 'time', 'grade', 'better', 'time', 'go', 'th', 'birthday', 'bought', 'drink', 'advanc', 'drink', 'price', 'averag', 'bar', 'although', 'mix', 'drink', 'particularli', 'delici', 'cup', 'kind', 'fun', 'keep', 'whole', 'place', 'remind', 'someth', 'would', 'find', 'vega', 'whole', 'entranc', 'room', 'decor', 'mediev', 'flag', 'armour', 'final', 'call', 'dinner', 'want', 'prefac', 'say', 'dinner', 'noth', 'special', 'kind', 'go', 'whole', 'goofi', 'experi', 'realli', 'fine', 'cuisin', 'get', 'tomato', 'bisqu', 'garlic', 'bread', 'half', 'chicken', 'potato', 'wedg', 'small', 'thing', 'rib', 'appl', 'pastri', 'dessert', 'everyth', 'serv', 'separ', 'togeth', 'your', 'eat', 'everyth', 'one', 'time', 'serv', 'wench', 'said', 'noth', 'particularli', 'impress', 'noth', 'bad', 'either', 'dont', 'get', 'cutleri', 'pick', 'everyth', 'finger', 'howev', 'give', 'wetnap', 'hot', 'towel', 'end', 'sister', 'order', 'vegetarian', 'meal', 'gave', 'veggi', 'shishkabob', 'said', 'quit', 'good', 'drink', 'water', 'pepsi', 'drink', 'order', 'barnow', 'onto', 'show', 'cheer', 'yell', 'like', 'crazi', 'peopl', 'entir', 'time', 'pick', 'fight', 'team', 'peopl', 'cheer', 'knight', 'pick', 'fight', 'back', 'laugh', 'cheer', 'jeer', 'knight', 'show', 'consist', 'hors', 'trick', 'falcon', 'fli', 'cours', 'knight', 'battl', 'everyth', 'exceedingli', 'cheesi', 'enjoy', 'anyway', 'cheesi', 'good', 'time', 'would', 'instantbut', 'right', 'crowdp', 'knight', 'think', 'cheer', 'loudest']

I headed over to Tires Plus, as I'm from out of town and didn't know any of the local places. After waiting in the lobby for an hour and a half just waiting for a simple patch job, I got frustrated and looked up local places for an alternative. 

I found the listing for Beaumont and gave them a call. They said they could get me right in. I drive over, and they had me out the door with an inexpensive, quality patch job in about fifteen minutes. 

This is a great place. They did great work, they did it quickly, and they lived up to their promise of getting me back on the road quickly, unlike the first place I tried. I'm not in Champaign often, but would absolutely recommend this place to anyone in my predicament.

I know for sure because I took a look.

then you never came back on the line, or picked up when I called back.

First, our order was messed up. Ok, they fixed it, but only after struggling to find someone else since our server mysteriously vanished.

Then, we tried to order some more drinks. Where did our server go? Oh, I see him. I made eye contact, and got ignored. I made eye contact and waved at several people, still no service. After finally getting a response (from the 4th person) our drinks are ordered. Do they come? No. Does the guy sitting next to me who ordered the same drink after me get his first? Yes.

I then went to the owner, who tried to tell me that there were only 2 servers working. As someone who has been a server and restaurant manager for 10+ years, I notice everything in the restaurant.  Everything. Especially the fact that there were 5 servers, 3 bussers, 2 managers, and when I'm being blatantly ignored and lied to.

So I would caution people on going and if you do go, stand your ground and only have done what YOU want done and refuse the rest	0	0	0	['gone', 'time', 'differ', 'car', 'time', 'car', 'say', 'x', 'amount', 'money', 'theyll', 'made', 'bill', 'well', 'feel', 'like', 'con', 'peopl', 'thing', 'probabl', 'need', 'done', 'everi', 'time', 'go', 'differ', 'person', 'charg', 'would', 'caution', 'peopl', 'go', 'go', 'stand', 'ground', 'done', 'want', 'done', 'refus', 'rest']

We happened to be by this location, and decided to stop in since we had not had it in  quite a while. I went to order a chicken wrap and was told they were out of chicken for the wraps. Then they told us we could order a chicken bowl because I don't like steak. My sister asked why couldn't they just put the bowl chicken in a wrap, but was told they could not do that. Makes you wonder how fresh their food is if their bowls are sitting there already made.	0	0	0	['locat', 'spars', 'hard', 'get', 'happen', 'locat', 'decid', 'stop', 'sinc', 'quit', 'went', 'order', 'chicken', 'wrap', 'told', 'chicken', 'wrap', 'told', 'us', 'could', 'order', 'chicken', 'bowl', 'dont', 'like', 'steak', 'sister', 'ask', 'couldnt', 'put', 'bowl', 'chicken', 'wrap', 'told', 'could', 'make', 'wonder', 'fresh', 'food', 'bowl', 'sit', 'alreadi', 'made']

Then it became US Storage. The prices immediately started going up. Trashcans disappeared so there was nowhere to throw away trash. The carts used to move items in and out became fewer. The place was always hot, I dont think its climate controlled. I just emptied my unit because of price hikes. The facility seems old with wooden floors and I never felt safe there.

With little counter space, this small place has a menu of 9 different tacos, priced at $5 each ($4 for the vegetarian option). I tried the blackened mahi mahi (grilled tuna) and the spicy shrimp w\/ cheese tacos on my first trip here, and I'll echo other's opinions that they do a fine job here. Double layered toasted, soft taco shells, and cooked to order with great flavours. Of the two, I preferred the spicy shrimp as it was pretty flavourful (read: spicy) and dripping with goodness (tip: grab some napkins). I'll be back to try the octopus!

It's a *union* of chiq and suave ambiance with a large space which makes it a good place for a *social* meet up with friends, family, or whoever else you meet with. 

The food started out mediocre out of the gates: the calamari ($10) was under-seasoned and the truffle fries ($8) were soggy. Not a good start.  Luckily, the entrees were much better. The almond crusted chicken fingers ($14) are breaded in an almond crumb batter and served with 3 sauces (mustard, bbq and ranch). It was a delightful ""union"" of flavours and textures; a really nice twist on your typical fingers and something I'd order again, and a dish that will get the table talking about - yay to *social*.

The salad with fig, mango and candied pecans ($10) *union*ized-together nicely, and you can add some protein on top for an extra $4. It was tasty and my protein of choice, steak, was well cooked, though a bit too cold. 

The flatbread ($10-$12 I think) looked alright, nothing to be *social* about there.

There's also a decent selection of wine ($8\/glass, $30\/bottle) and beers (about $6-8 a pint) to really keep you *social*ly lubricated .

If you've never had Afghani food, I'd compare it too... greek food with added spices. You have different kabobs (or kabAbs as their name implies) and meats of different variety and spices grilled on skewers (mostly).  Add some rice, some garden salad, and you have a middle eastern version of Greek food. 

Anyway, the food is good. Some may find it spicy, but most people I've brought here have really enjoyed it. The dishes are prepared when you order, or close to it, so it can be a 10-15 minute wait for your food.

Nearly all the meat dishes I've had are good here, here's a few:
Kofta: some mixture of beef, garlic and other spices.  It's garlic heavy, so bring some tic-tacs or a tooth brush if you're going back to work. It's the cheapest item, but it'll still fill you up and it's good.  Comes with two skewers.
Chaplee: think of two big burger patties with chilli spices in them. You'll get stuffed. May be a bit hot for some.
Sultani: the king of the dishes, the most expensive, it comes with a skewer of beef tenderloin or filet mignon (forget which, but it's delicious), and a kofta skewer
Tandoori: Tandoori chicken is flavourful, but sometimes a bit dry.  Comes with one skewer.
Chicken: chicken breast  with some spices. My least favorite, as the chicken isn't overly spiced and can be dry at times.

On average, it'll cost you about $10 for a plate without rice, and $13 for a plate with rice, depending on the meat you get of course.

Pro: simple, the food is really good

Cons: a bit pricey for the dinners here, it can be a long wait at lunch since they make the dish when you order, not a huge fan on the naan bread they give you here. It's Afghan type naan, I prefer the Indian naan. This naan, though fresh, is tougher and harder than Indian naan.

Tip: If you're having lunch, I'd suggest getting the kabob plate without rice. It's a few dollars cheaper and the dinner plate with rice will likely put you to sleep at work... it's HEAVY.   The rice though is delicious, so if you go with a group I'd suggest getting individual plates without rice, then ordering a side plate of rice. They give you plenty of rice and it's cheaper this way.  And you can portion it so you don't need an afternoon nap!"	4	1	1	['work', 'area', 'bamiyan', 'stapl', 'lunch', 'rotat', 'never', 'fail', 'offer', 'good', 'mealif', 'youv', 'never', 'afghani', 'food', 'id', 'compar', 'greek', 'food', 'ad', 'spice', 'differ', 'kabob', 'kabab', 'name', 'impli', 'meat', 'differ', 'varieti', 'spice', 'grill', 'skewer', 'mostli', 'add', 'rice', 'garden', 'salad', 'middl', 'eastern', 'version', 'greek', 'food', 'anyway', 'food', 'good', 'may', 'find', 'spici', 'peopl', 'ive', 'brought', 'realli', 'enjoy', 'dish', 'prepar', 'order', 'close', 'minut', 'wait', 'foodnearli', 'meat', 'dish', 'ive', 'good', 'here', 'fewkofta', 'mixtur', 'beef', 'garlic', 'spice', 'garlic', 'heavi', 'bring', 'tictac', 'tooth', 'brush', 'your', 'go', 'back', 'work', 'cheapest', 'item', 'itll', 'still', 'fill', 'good', 'come', 'two', 'skewerschaple', 'think', 'two', 'big', 'burger', 'patti', 'chilli', 'spice', 'youll', 'get', 'stuf', 'may', 'bit', 'hot', 'somesultani', 'king', 'dish', 'expens', 'come', 'skewer', 'beef', 'tenderloin', 'filet', 'mignon', 'forget', 'delici', 'kofta', 'skewertandoori', 'tandoori', 'chicken', 'flavour', 'sometim', 'bit', 'dri', 'come', 'one', 'skewerchicken', 'chicken', 'breast', 'spice', 'least', 'favorit', 'chicken', 'isnt', 'overli', 'spice', 'dri', 'timeson', 'averag', 'itll', 'cost', 'plate', 'without', 'rice', 'plate', 'rice', 'depend', 'meat', 'get', 'coursepro', 'simpl', 'food', 'realli', 'goodcon', 'bit', 'pricey', 'dinner', 'long', 'wait', 'lunch', 'sinc', 'make', 'dish', 'order', 'huge', 'fan', 'naan', 'bread', 'give', 'afghan', 'type', 'naan', 'prefer', 'indian', 'naan', 'naan', 'though', 'fresh', 'tougher', 'harder', 'indian', 'naantip', 'your', 'lunch', 'id', 'suggest', 'get', 'kabob', 'plate', 'without', 'rice', 'dollar', 'cheaper', 'dinner', 'plate', 'rice', 'like', 'put', 'sleep', 'work', 'heavi', 'rice', 'though', 'delici', 'go', 'group', 'id', 'suggest', 'get', 'individu', 'plate', 'without', 'rice', 'order', 'side', 'plate', 'rice', 'give', 'plenti', 'rice', 'cheaper', 'way', 'portion', 'dont', 'need', 'afternoon', 'nap']

If you're in the mood for the meat sweats, the all you can eat menu here is a good choice (and the only thing I've tried the two times I've been). They have a regular menu as well, but I've only tried the all you can eat menu here (twice) so that's all I'm going to review.

For about $28 after tip and taxes on a Friday, you get mounds and mounds of Kalbi ribs, bulgogi beef, pork, and other variations of Korean meats. The quality of the meats is good, and I would say better compared to other Korean BBQ's that I have tried in Toronto.  

The Kalbi Beef is well marinated and you can't wait to dig in as you wait for it to grill up in front of you.  But all the meat is good, and if you and your friends are hungry, this will do the job.

For the weekend dinner, the meal also comes with some ""extras"" which are not all you can eat, last time I got a skewer of shrimp and scallops, and fried shrimp (torpedo style).

As typical for Korean restaurants, they serve a number of side dishes along with your meal, which you can ask to be refilled at any time. These are your typical kimchi, pickled radishes, etc. that you come to expect from any Korean establishment.  

The BBQs here are the typical gas burners, not the coal type which are so rare and hard to find in Toronto.

My biggest criticism with the all you can eat menu here is that you cannot order lettuce or other sides which are typically used to ""wrap"" the meat as part of the menu. Orders of lettuce will cost you extra.  This is a bit confusing to me, as the cost for lettuce is really, really cheap compared to the meat they're providing.

All in all though, I don't think there's anything distinctively special about this place, though if you want a large, unhealthy serving of meat (we all crave this once in a while) then it's a good choice."	3	0	1	['uptown', 'ktown', 'shortag', 'korean', 'restaur', 'plenti', 'area', 'good', 'your', 'mood', 'meat', 'sweat', 'eat', 'menu', 'good', 'choic', 'thing', 'ive', 'tri', 'two', 'time', 'ive', 'regular', 'menu', 'well', 'ive', 'tri', 'eat', 'menu', 'twice', 'that', 'im', 'go', 'reviewfor', 'tip', 'tax', 'friday', 'get', 'mound', 'mound', 'kalbi', 'rib', 'bulgogi', 'beef', 'pork', 'variat', 'korean', 'meat', 'qualiti', 'meat', 'good', 'would', 'say', 'better', 'compar', 'korean', 'bbq', 'tri', 'toronto', 'kalbi', 'beef', 'well', 'marin', 'cant', 'wait', 'dig', 'wait', 'grill', 'front', 'meat', 'good', 'friend', 'hungri', 'jobfor', 'weekend', 'dinner', 'meal', 'also', 'come', 'extra', 'eat', 'last', 'time', 'got', 'skewer', 'shrimp', 'scallop', 'fri', 'shrimp', 'torpedo', 'stylea', 'typic', 'korean', 'restaur', 'serv', 'number', 'side', 'dish', 'along', 'meal', 'ask', 'refil', 'time', 'typic', 'kimchi', 'pickl', 'radish', 'etc', 'come', 'expect', 'korean', 'establish', 'bbq', 'typic', 'ga', 'burner', 'coal', 'type', 'rare', 'hard', 'find', 'torontomi', 'biggest', 'critic', 'eat', 'menu', 'cannot', 'order', 'lettuc', 'side', 'typic', 'use', 'wrap', 'meat', 'part', 'menu', 'order', 'lettuc', 'cost', 'extra', 'bit', 'confus', 'cost', 'lettuc', 'realli', 'realli', 'cheap', 'compar', 'meat', 'theyr', 'providingal', 'though', 'dont', 'think', 'there', 'anyth', 'distinct', 'special', 'place', 'though', 'want', 'larg', 'unhealthi', 'serv', 'meat', 'crave', 'good', 'choic']

You'd think it's easy to cook, but there really is an art to it. The right batter with good seasoning, the right temperature to the oil, crisp fries and for the love of God, fresh fish! So given the great ratings on Yelp, I was pretty excited to finally have the chance to try Fresco's... and boy was I disappointed. 

I was expecting greatness, but what I got was a small portion of overcooked, dry and flavorless fish and soggy and under seasoned fries for $15.

I had the halibut, and being my first time I had it done half and half (half regular batter, half Ms. Vickie's).  The Ms. Vickie's batter is definitely the better of the two, have more crunch and texture, while the regular batter was soft and just not good. 

The fish wasn't overly oily, which is good, but the fish itself was very dry.  You know how in good fish and chips, the fish will flake apart? That lovely texture that just falls apart in your mouth? Well, this isn't it. The fish was chewy, dry and definitely wasn't seasoned. I ended up throwing a ton of seasoning salt, lemon and tartar sauce on it just to give it some life. 

Onto the second part of the equation: fries. They sure looked delicious, but again the lack of seasoning hurt the verdict, and the fries were a big soggy to boot.  

I'm not trying to be dramatic, but I expected a lot more from a place which has a 4.5 stars average rating on Yelp (which I treat like the bible).

It's not many times Yelp will disappoint me, but this was definitely one of them."	2	1	1	['im', 'picki', 'fish', 'n', 'chip', 'ye', 'im', 'madonna', 'easi', 'screw', 'fish', 'chip', 'youd', 'think', 'easi', 'cook', 'realli', 'art', 'right', 'batter', 'good', 'season', 'right', 'temperatur', 'oil', 'crisp', 'fri', 'love', 'god', 'fresh', 'fish', 'given', 'great', 'rate', 'yelp', 'pretti', 'excit', 'final', 'chanc', 'tri', 'fresco', 'boy', 'disappoint', 'expect', 'great', 'got', 'small', 'portion', 'overcook', 'dri', 'flavorless', 'fish', 'soggi', 'season', 'fri', 'halibut', 'first', 'time', 'done', 'half', 'half', 'half', 'regular', 'batter', 'half', 'ms', 'vicki', 'ms', 'vicki', 'batter', 'definit', 'better', 'two', 'crunch', 'textur', 'regular', 'batter', 'soft', 'good', 'fish', 'wasnt', 'overli', 'oili', 'good', 'fish', 'dri', 'know', 'good', 'fish', 'chip', 'fish', 'flake', 'apart', 'love', 'textur', 'fall', 'apart', 'mouth', 'well', 'isnt', 'fish', 'chewi', 'dri', 'definit', 'wasnt', 'season', 'end', 'throw', 'ton', 'season', 'salt', 'lemon', 'tartar', 'sauc', 'give', 'life', 'onto', 'second', 'part', 'equat', 'fri', 'sure', 'look', 'delici', 'lack', 'season', 'hurt', 'verdict', 'fri', 'big', 'soggi', 'boot', 'im', 'tri', 'dramat', 'expect', 'lot', 'place', 'star', 'averag', 'rate', 'yelp', 'treat', 'like', 'bibleit', 'mani', 'time', 'yelp', 'disappoint', 'definit', 'one']

Older commercial building which have seen better days line the streets. Looking left you see some closed up shops, looking right much of the same. 
Or maybe I was just in a mind-altered-movie-state during TIFF weekend. 

Any ways, even on a Friday afternoon Gryfe's had a few customers in line, each ordering a dozen of whichever types of bagels they had on hand. When they're fully stocked, there's about a dozen varieties, although they're all fairly traditional choices: sesame, poppy seed, extra poppy seed, flax, everything, cinnamon raisin, plain, etc. Soft, fluffy and airy, these bagels are pretty good if you're into that kinda thing. They're $0.60 each or $7.20 a dozen. 

That being said, I personally enjoy bagels with a it more chew and texture to them (like Montreal style bagels), but regardless, the carb-monster inside of me made yet another appearance when I picked these up, as I quickly devoured two bagels and an apple turnover.  I can certainly see why folks like the bagels, IF they like the soft and fluffy variety. They also toast up pretty well, which adds some good texture to it and is much more down my alley. The apple turnover ($1.15) was good, though the apple filling could have used more cinnamon. 

They ran out of their $1 pizzas by Friday afternoon, since they're closed on Saturday and don't want to bake more in case they don't sell out that night. Great to know that everything here is fresh!

If you do come here, I'd suggest you do not come on a Friday afternoon, as a lot of their bagel varieties and pizzas are sold out. 

I'm giving it 3 stars mainly because I'm simply not a fan of the softer, fluffier type of bagel, but they're good, all-in-all.

The venue itself was alright. It has a long bar that makes it relatively easy to line up against for drinks and high ceilings which give it an open airy feel. 

Bottles of beer were $7-8, well drinks $8. We came early so it ended up being a pretty expensive night .

I'm not a fan of mandatory coat checks, which they have here, especially when you have parts of your group who just want to drop by for a bit. 

The crowd was old(er), which makes sense given the Nostalgia night. I'd definitely come back for Nostalgia nights, 'cause the music was just awesome.

Anyway, saw the previous review by Kat on this hidden little bakery that's really close to my workplace, so I decided to stop by after having watched an episode of Cake Boss last night and feeling the need for a cannoli. I shake my first at you Buddy Valastro, darn you for destroying my diet!

Cordi has freshly baked Caldenese bread, rye bread, bagels, croissants, and an assortment of Italian pastries including cannolis, chocolate cannolis, zeppole, cinnamon buns, cakes and whatnot.  They also had a deli section which had a few people ordering from.

I picked up a cannoli, a chocolate cannoli, a cinnamon bun and a zeppole. 

My virgin experience with a zeppole, so I can't really compare, but it the zeppole is SUPER creamy, sort of like a donut with massive amounts of cream and cheese. It was alright. I'll have to try out zeppole at some other bakeries to really compare. 

The cannolis had a crunchy shell and creamy filling with chocolate chips.  A nice crunchy shell (nothing worse than a soggy\/soft shell on a cannoli) but the shell was a bit too thick for my liking. All in all it was good though. 

The cinnamon bun was average, nothing to rave about and comparable to what you could get at other bakeries or a supermarket. 

I'll have to try the caldenese bread next time, which looked pretty good and the cherry and apple turnovers, but I'll save those calories for another day.

Off first impressions, I prefer Nova bakery to Cordi, but I'll give Cordi another shot since it's a bit closer.

For those who want to read on:
The owners of this little spot are brave souls, with Paramount, Bamiyan Kababa and Pita & Grill all within the vicinity of this restaurant, they're going to have some tough competition. 

This small shop located at the corner of Dixie and Eglington (connected to the Canadian tire gas bar store and Mary Browns) servers up falafel, chicken and beef schwarmas and dinner plates. I think they also have chicken breast kebabs, but I can't be sure. It's a small menu and small shop, meant to be a quick grab and go. 

Some smart cookies running the place. They had a $2.99 promo running last week for a falafel, chicken or beef schwarma to get the word out (regular $5.99) and it did manage to generate some buzz as there were fairly long lines during lunch for the special. For $2.99, it's a steal...for $5.99.......... questionable. 

I tried the chicken shawarma. The chicken didn't have much flavor, there wasn't a whole lot of meat, but it was larger than the tiny sandwich offerings at Paramount.  It was your standard chicken shawarma, topped with the standard lettuce, tomato, garlic sauce and hummus (you can add parsley as well, which I would recommend), wrapped in your standard pita and grilled in your standard panini press for several seconds. It may be because the line was long and they were trying to get people through, but the shawarma wasn't put in the press for long enough to do it's work. The whole thing was just standard, middle of the road shawarma. 

As I mentioned, there are other middle eastern options in the area, and in my opinion they're all better than Anoush.  I was told the beef was better, and I'm willing to give it another try. Maybe it'll be a different experience if they're not rushed because of long lines."	2	0	0	['quick', 'one', 'liner', 'standard', 'shawarma', 'garlic', 'sauc', 'underwhelm', 'comparison', 'id', 'prefer', 'pita', 'grill', 'street', 'bamiyan', 'liter', 'across', 'streetfor', 'want', 'read', 'onth', 'owner', 'littl', 'spot', 'brave', 'soul', 'paramount', 'bamiyan', 'kababa', 'pita', 'grill', 'within', 'vicin', 'restaur', 'theyr', 'go', 'tough', 'competit', 'small', 'shop', 'locat', 'corner', 'dixi', 'eglington', 'connect', 'canadian', 'tire', 'ga', 'bar', 'store', 'mari', 'brown', 'server', 'falafel', 'chicken', 'beef', 'schwarma', 'dinner', 'plate', 'think', 'also', 'chicken', 'breast', 'kebab', 'cant', 'sure', 'small', 'menu', 'small', 'shop', 'meant', 'quick', 'grab', 'go', 'smart', 'cooki', 'run', 'place', 'promo', 'run', 'last', 'week', 'falafel', 'chicken', 'beef', 'schwarma', 'get', 'word', 'regular', 'manag', 'gener', 'buzz', 'fairli', 'long', 'line', 'lunch', 'special', 'stealfor', 'question', 'tri', 'chicken', 'shawarma', 'chicken', 'didnt', 'much', 'flavor', 'wasnt', 'whole', 'lot', 'meat', 'larger', 'tini', 'sandwich', 'offer', 'paramount', 'standard', 'chicken', 'shawarma', 'top', 'standard', 'lettuc', 'tomato', 'garlic', 'sauc', 'hummu', 'add', 'parsley', 'well', 'would', 'recommend', 'wrap', 'standard', 'pita', 'grill', 'standard', 'panini', 'press', 'sever', 'second', 'may', 'line', 'long', 'tri', 'get', 'peopl', 'shawarma', 'wasnt', 'put', 'press', 'long', 'enough', 'work', 'whole', 'thing', 'standard', 'middl', 'road', 'shawarma', 'mention', 'middl', 'eastern', 'option', 'area', 'opinion', 'theyr', 'better', 'anoush', 'told', 'beef', 'better', 'im', 'will', 'give', 'anoth', 'tri', 'mayb', 'itll', 'differ', 'experi', 'theyr', 'rush', 'long', 'line']

With great pizza, decent pasta and other entrees for $15-20, Fiamma is classier lunch option for those looking for a sit down environment with good ambiance.  If you do come here, get the pizza, it's superb.

But... Tony, Tony, Tony... sigh.  What can I say, our waiter, Tony, completely destroyed our experience here.  Tony, take a page from Toni, Tony, Tone; service is about ""Whatever you want"" and not pissing off your patrons (to be blunt).

Sometimes you want a coffee shop to grab a quick brew, a morning snack, or a quick bite. And often for me, I just need a place to just sit down and do some work on my lappy - and the most important thing in these instances is the internet. 

While this is your standard Country Style location, if you just want to grab a coffee, a donut or a sandwich it'll do just fine. But the internet here is horrendous. The advertise it as hassle free, but it's too slow to do anything. Google itself will barely load. So with persistent internet issues, I must deem this place Not Good For Work (NGFW).

I drove by after work and it was packed though, so this definitely seems like a local hangout.  And why shouldn't it be?

The rest of the menu seemed fairly standard priced, with entrees ranging from$7-18.

Ambiance is your standard pub, bar seating on one side with tables spread out amongst the rest of the establishment and wood decor everywhere.  I didn't notice too many screens (though but I wasn't paying particular attention).

I know we have laws here to to make sure the beef is well done, but I love my burgers a bit pink in the middle, and the Burger's Priest does this beautifully.  

I tried the double-double.  The loosely packed patty is nicely cooked, seared on the outside and oh so juicy on the inside.  The bread and lettuce are fresh, and the cheese is beautifully melted; the double double was reminiscent of some of the finer burger's I've had in my life, most comparable to Shake Shack in NYC.

I want to knock off a star because of the price point ($9 after taxes is a bit pricey for a smallish double patty burger - think In' n' out size - with no drinks or fries, out of the downtown core with no seating), but this place is the best I've had in the GTA, so I'll give it 5 until I find some place better.

During a quick trip back to TO, a friend mentioned I should try this new joint that serves up Chinese Jamaican food. Not having had Chinese food nor Jamaican food in a while I wandered up to Bathurst and Dundas to find a small joint with a fun, modern deco Caribbean vibe - not exactly what I expected in the area. 

Starting with some TGIF drinks, they had a decent beer menu, but the cocktails were awesome. You can even get them in a ""teapot"" which is not only cute, but great value - I think there were like 6 or 7 drinks in there. Try the one with 5 spice and ginger beer, and thank me later. (seriously, Yelp Thank You's are appreciated :) )

Between a few of us we tried a lot, but the real winners here are the Dirty Fried Rice, the Jerk Chicken, Double Down Patty and burger. 
 
You know when you expecting something to be a certain way, but then it's not? Like when you're sure your parents bought you another sweater for Christmas, the box is the right size and shape, but you open it up and you find out it was a camouflaged box and inside is the most awesomest Ninja Turtles toy ever (true story). That's my impression of Patios. Everything has a familiarity to it - but with a twist that makes you think, ""wow, that's different"". 

Case in point, the fried rice: looking at it you think, ""this is going to taste like every other fried rice I've had in my life"", but when you take that first bite: BAM. It's got this nice sweet twist that I can't put my finger on. But it that makes you think, why isn't fried rice always made like this? 

Now the burger... man... the burger is done with a pineapple bun (in Chinese, it's called a bo lo bao), this awesome Chinese bread with a slightly sweet\/crunchy\/bready topping that just about every Chinese kid loved growing up. Throw a double patty in the middle of that thing? Brilliant. 

If you're like me and have a thing for rotisserie chicken, you'll love the jerk. It's not your typical jerk chicken that's slathered in sauce, but it's well spiced, a good flavor without being overwhelming, and juicy as heck from the rotisserie. Pair it with a spicy (as heck) sauce, and you got a winner. 

The double-down patty is twist on Colonel Sander's invention, throwing a thick slab of good-ol bacon and melted cheese between two Jamaican patties. Seriously, throwing those ingredients together is like using a cheat code. 

Being away from Toronto for a few months and coming back, it quickly reminded me of the awesome food we have here and the familiarity of the food gave me a sense of deja vu, combining oldies I loved with a new twist."	8	4	4	['awesom', 'oldi', 'chopstick', 'lick', 'good', 'twist', 'great', 'drink', 'vibedur', 'quick', 'trip', 'back', 'friend', 'mention', 'tri', 'new', 'joint', 'serv', 'chines', 'jamaican', 'food', 'chines', 'food', 'jamaican', 'food', 'wander', 'bathurst', 'dunda', 'find', 'small', 'joint', 'fun', 'modern', 'deco', 'caribbean', 'vibe', 'exactli', 'expect', 'area', 'start', 'tgif', 'drink', 'decent', 'beer', 'menu', 'cocktail', 'awesom', 'even', 'get', 'teapot', 'cute', 'great', 'valu', 'think', 'like', 'drink', 'tri', 'one', 'spice', 'ginger', 'beer', 'thank', 'later', 'serious', 'yelp', 'thank', 'you', 'appreci', 'us', 'tri', 'lot', 'real', 'winner', 'dirti', 'fri', 'rice', 'jerk', 'chicken', 'doubl', 'patti', 'burger', 'know', 'expect', 'someth', 'certain', 'way', 'like', 'your', 'sure', 'parent', 'bought', 'anoth', 'sweater', 'christma', 'box', 'right', 'size', 'shape', 'open', 'find', 'camouflag', 'box', 'insid', 'awesomest', 'ninja', 'turtl', 'toy', 'ever', 'true', 'stori', 'that', 'impress', 'patio', 'everyth', 'familiar', 'twist', 'make', 'think', 'wow', 'that', 'differ', 'case', 'point', 'fri', 'rice', 'look', 'think', 'go', 'tast', 'like', 'everi', 'fri', 'rice', 'ive', 'life', 'take', 'first', 'bite', 'bam', 'got', 'nice', 'sweet', 'twist', 'cant', 'put', 'finger', 'make', 'think', 'isnt', 'fri', 'rice', 'alway', 'made', 'like', 'burger', 'man', 'burger', 'done', 'pineappl', 'bun', 'chines', 'call', 'bo', 'lo', 'bao', 'awesom', 'chines', 'bread', 'slightli', 'sweetcrunchybreadi', 'top', 'everi', 'chines', 'kid', 'love', 'grow', 'throw', 'doubl', 'patti', 'middl', 'thing', 'brilliant', 'your', 'like', 'thing', 'rotisseri', 'chicken', 'youll', 'love', 'jerk', 'typic', 'jerk', 'chicken', 'that', 'slather', 'sauc', 'well', 'spice', 'good', 'flavor', 'without', 'overwhelm', 'juici', 'heck', 'rotisseri', 'pair', 'spici', 'heck', 'sauc', 'got', 'winner', 'doubledown', 'patti', 'twist', 'colonel', 'sander', 'invent', 'throw', 'thick', 'slab', 'goodol', 'bacon', 'melt', 'chees', 'two', 'jamaican', 'patti', 'serious', 'throw', 'ingredi', 'togeth', 'like', 'use', 'cheat', 'code', 'away', 'toronto', 'month', 'come', 'back', 'quickli', 'remind', 'awesom', 'food', 'familiar', 'food', 'gave', 'sens', 'deja', 'vu', 'combin', 'oldi', 'love', 'new', 'twist']

Don't: come here expecting pork!

Chinese Halal. Um, what? Say that again? Chinese. Halal.
I'll have to admit, this was a complete head scratcher for me. Who knew these was such cuisine? Located at the back of plaza at Leslie & Finch, I met a friend for lunch here and was pleasantly surprised at the twist on Chinese dishes here. 

My friend said the food is actually classified as Islamic, so all the dishes are lamb or beef. 

I've got to say, I've seen seen so many different preparations of lamb before.

Lamb ribs coated with sesame and pan fried, interesting... and delicious! The lamb was soft and tasty, though I would have loved it more if the skin were a bit crispier. ($13)

The lamb soup comes loaded with lamb meat, so make sure you scoop from the bottom! ($9)

The lamb leg is the only dish I'd pass on again. For $9 it's a small piece of lamb and a bit too salty for my liking.

The review:
Any Pho place with nice decor is automatically suspect in my books. The better pho I've had has usually been at dives and places where you make sure you wipe down your utensils before using them. So walking into WonderPho alarms immediately went off.

I came here without reading any Yelp reviews, and after reading them now, my experience was similar. 

More expensive than other places, and cruddy service (we were the ONLY table there, yet the waiter didn't come by once during our meal to check up on us. I had to call him over i.e. yell, to get more water).  

I ordered the Seafood Pho. DO NOT GET IT.  It's one of the more expensive items on the menu, but you get two mussels, two pieces of fake crab, two tiny shrimps, and two tiny pieces of overcooked squid.  Definitely get one the beef base Pho or Curry dishes.

The positives are that the noodles themselves were actually decent, and from what I could tell of my friend's beef broth and curry broths, those were ok as well. The base isn't quite as oily as other Pho places, which is good or bad, depending how you look at it. 

Based on the seafood Pho alone, there's much better Pho to be had. And with plenty of options in that area (Dragon Pearl, a thai and japanese buffet next door, kelseys, coras, pizza, wings, freshi, etc.) unless you're craving Pho, I'd go somewhere else.

If I do end up coming again, I'll be sure to try a Rare Beef Pho (i.e. a 101 at most places) to compare the staple and report back."	3	0	0	['summari', 'overpr', 'pho', 'decent', 'noodl', 'ok', 'broth', 'seafood', 'pho', 'terribl', 'definit', 'get', 'id', 'stick', 'beef', 'broth', 'base', 'pho', 'curri', 'baseth', 'reviewani', 'pho', 'place', 'nice', 'decor', 'automat', 'suspect', 'book', 'better', 'pho', 'ive', 'usual', 'dive', 'place', 'make', 'sure', 'wipe', 'utensil', 'use', 'walk', 'wonderpho', 'alarm', 'immedi', 'went', 'offi', 'came', 'without', 'read', 'yelp', 'review', 'read', 'experi', 'similar', 'expens', 'place', 'cruddi', 'servic', 'tabl', 'yet', 'waiter', 'didnt', 'come', 'meal', 'check', 'us', 'call', 'ie', 'yell', 'get', 'water', 'order', 'seafood', 'pho', 'get', 'one', 'expens', 'item', 'menu', 'get', 'two', 'mussel', 'two', 'piec', 'fake', 'crab', 'two', 'tini', 'shrimp', 'two', 'tini', 'piec', 'overcook', 'squid', 'definit', 'get', 'one', 'beef', 'base', 'pho', 'curri', 'dishesth', 'posit', 'noodl', 'actual', 'decent', 'could', 'tell', 'friend', 'beef', 'broth', 'curri', 'broth', 'ok', 'well', 'base', 'isnt', 'quit', 'oili', 'pho', 'place', 'good', 'bad', 'depend', 'look', 'base', 'seafood', 'pho', 'alon', 'there', 'much', 'better', 'pho', 'plenti', 'option', 'area', 'dragon', 'pearl', 'thai', 'japanes', 'buffet', 'next', 'door', 'kelsey', 'cora', 'pizza', 'wing', 'freshi', 'etc', 'unless', 'your', 'crave', 'pho', 'id', 'go', 'somewher', 'elseif', 'end', 'come', 'ill', 'sure', 'tri', 'rare', 'beef', 'pho', 'ie', 'place', 'compar', 'stapl', 'report', 'back']

(1) Yes, it's pricey
(2) Yes, they will try to upsize your lobster

If you read *any* of the Yelp reviews or talked to anyone before coming here, you'd know that, so let's just get that out of the way. This leads me to my 3rd point....

(3) but man, it's goooooood

Simply put, I've never had this much lobster in my life. Ever. There were 10 of us and we had the 10-12 set dinner, which comes with 14 lbs of lobster (done 2 ways), a king crab, fish, eel, deep fried oyster, lobster fried rice, soups and veggies so you don't feel quite as bad. 

The amount of food here was absolutely ridiculous... and I eat a lot. Mountains of lobster friend with garlic and onion... it's staggering to see. You can get spicy versions, which I love.  Beautifully fried, it doesn't only look great, it tastes pretty darn good too. 

If you're a seafood lover, you'll be in heaven. The oysters were served first, one per person, breaded and battered with chinese eggs (I don't know what to call it in english, but in cantonese it's ""ham dan"") they were fantastic. The king crab is served with egg whites, which was an interesting touch. The egg whites make the crab meat seem even smoother and silkier. The fish was your standard chinese steamed fish. The lobster fried rice was also really good. But the star of the show is clearly the mountains of lobster that come to your table.

The price of the lobster itself isn't so bad at $17\/lb. It's the king crab that gets you, at $40\/lb. I think our crab alone was close to $300. Quite honestly, we could have left out the king crab and we'd have plenty of food still, so next time I might order a la carte in that fashion. In fact, we took home two trays or lobster home (probably 1.5 lobsters).

Also, be sure to tell the server upfront that you want exactly 14lb (or whatever the set meal comes with). If they push back saying they don't have a lobster with that exact size and try to upsize you, just politely say no, and you can ask for several smaller lobsters instead, totalling 14lb. 

If you get the set meals, you'll be spending $60-80 pp after taxes and tips, so be warned. If you manage to do the ala carte, it'd be much more reasonable, likely around $40 pp."	14	2	2	['first', 'thing', 'first', 'ye', 'pricey', 'ye', 'tri', 'upsiz', 'lobsterif', 'read', 'yelp', 'review', 'talk', 'anyon', 'come', 'youd', 'know', 'let', 'get', 'way', 'lead', 'rd', 'point', 'man', 'gooooooodsimpli', 'put', 'ive', 'never', 'much', 'lobster', 'life', 'ever', 'us', 'set', 'dinner', 'come', 'lb', 'lobster', 'done', 'way', 'king', 'crab', 'fish', 'eel', 'deep', 'fri', 'oyster', 'lobster', 'fri', 'rice', 'soup', 'veggi', 'dont', 'feel', 'quit', 'bad', 'amount', 'food', 'absolut', 'ridicul', 'eat', 'lot', 'mountain', 'lobster', 'friend', 'garlic', 'onion', 'stagger', 'see', 'get', 'spici', 'version', 'love', 'beauti', 'fri', 'doesnt', 'look', 'great', 'tast', 'pretti', 'darn', 'good', 'your', 'seafood', 'lover', 'youll', 'heaven', 'oyster', 'serv', 'first', 'one', 'per', 'person', 'bread', 'batter', 'chines', 'egg', 'dont', 'know', 'call', 'english', 'cantones', 'ham', 'dan', 'fantast', 'king', 'crab', 'serv', 'egg', 'white', 'interest', 'touch', 'egg', 'white', 'make', 'crab', 'meat', 'seem', 'even', 'smoother', 'silkier', 'fish', 'standard', 'chines', 'steam', 'fish', 'lobster', 'fri', 'rice', 'also', 'realli', 'good', 'star', 'show', 'clearli', 'mountain', 'lobster', 'come', 'tableth', 'price', 'lobster', 'isnt', 'bad', 'lb', 'king', 'crab', 'get', 'lb', 'think', 'crab', 'alon', 'close', 'quit', 'honestli', 'could', 'left', 'king', 'crab', 'wed', 'plenti', 'food', 'still', 'next', 'time', 'might', 'order', 'la', 'cart', 'fashion', 'fact', 'took', 'home', 'two', 'tray', 'lobster', 'home', 'probabl', 'lobstersalso', 'sure', 'tell', 'server', 'upfront', 'want', 'exactli', 'lb', 'whatev', 'set', 'meal', 'come', 'push', 'back', 'say', 'dont', 'lobster', 'exact', 'size', 'tri', 'upsiz', 'polit', 'say', 'ask', 'sever', 'smaller', 'lobster', 'instead', 'total', 'lb', 'get', 'set', 'meal', 'youll', 'spend', 'pp', 'tax', 'tip', 'warn', 'manag', 'ala', 'cart', 'itd', 'much', 'reason', 'like', 'around', 'pp']

So being in the St. Lawrence market area I decided to try Stonemill, which so many of my fellow Yelp friends have said good things about. 

The raspberry twist was pretty good, crisp, flaky and sweet, just as I like 'em! And considering I got it late in the afternoon I'd love to try a fresh one in the early morn.

The chocolate almond danish was a bit of a disappointment. It was soft and buttery,  but too soft for my liking and didn't lend itself any texture. Maybe it's cause I picked one up late in the afternoon - but it is what it is.

They ran $1.59 each.

For lunch, this location is packed like a mall on Christmas eve, especially considering the location is fairly tucked away. 

With this amount of turnover, the food is fresh and pretty good.  I wouldn't say the meat is substantially better than other schwarma places in the area, such as Pita & Grill, nothing that blows me away.  The portions of the sandwich are also pretty small.

The best thing is probably the pita bread, which is really fresh and is all puffy and steaming when it gets to your table. 

The hummus is creamier than most other places.

Garlic sauce is alright, but I think the one at Pita & Grill up the street is better.

I think this place is a bit overpriced, ($11 + tax for a chicken schwarma plate, I've uploaded a pic of their price list) for what you get compared to other schwarma places.

One of my biggest complaints is the rule of no outside water. My kids are past diaper and stroller stage, so I have nowhere to ""hide"" these items. I walked in one day, had my water bottle taken from me, was forced to drink nasty drinking fountain water, or spend money on bottled water. Then, I looked over and watched all the moms pulling water bottles from their diaper bags and strollers. Nice rule, Airworx!

I visited Dr Kim initially for complications brought about by fertility treatments, including heart problems typical of being thrown into a type of menopause in my thirties! I have been under Dr Kim's care for only 4 months and through a combination of herbal medicine, acupuncture and dietary therapy, I am thankful each day for the healing that has already happened as well as continues to happen in restoring my health. I recently visited a cardiologist who confirmed Dr Kim's diagnosis, it was great to experience both models of medicine aligning fully.

Dr Kim has a calm and quietly confident energy that surely must come from generations of medicine, and always takes the time to understand where I am on each particular day. There have been times where I've forgotten to mention something and somehow Dr Kim always just seems to know anyway. I always leave feeling a lot better and enjoy the cleanliness of the clinkc as well as the genuine friendliness of the staff too.

I'm forever grateful to Dr Kim for restoring my health and look forward to updating as his treatment plan continues to deliver!

Now as far as this location goes, its a great location for those who live in Sun Prairie. It is located right in the middle of the new intersection near their new movie theatre (which is fantastic by the way). Some simple seating, a counter, and a wall with bags to your left is what your greeted with. This location was pretty clean and the staff was pretty friendly as well. We had never been here before and a really nice employee came over and explained the whole shebang to us. Simple enough, grab a bag the size you want, choose the base of the sandwich (I got the cubano) and choose all the fixin's your little hear desires.

Here is where it sort of started going a little down hill. There were six of us which I know is a big order but it looked like they had a pretty organized line for the actual manufacturing of the sandwich. It took a lot longer for the sandwiches to be made than I thought. About 30 minutes for one or two of them. My sandwich was pretty poorly made with half of the ingredients falling out of it when I pulled it out of the now oily brown paper bag. The sandwich I asked for toasted and was warm on one side and the other was as if it came out of the fridge. Again it is a chain so my expectations weren't a gourmet melt or anything. They also doused a very strong mustard on the sandwich but only in one spot... Which was a nice shock to my taste buds.

I'll probably return to another Wich Wich some time, maybe not this one just because of where I live but it wasn't the worst place i've ever been."	1	0	1	['isnt', 'much', 'said', 'chain', 'ill', 'best', 'make', 'interest', 'accur', 'possibl', 'far', 'locat', 'goe', 'great', 'locat', 'live', 'sun', 'prairi', 'locat', 'right', 'middl', 'new', 'intersect', 'near', 'new', 'movi', 'theatr', 'fantast', 'way', 'simpl', 'seat', 'counter', 'wall', 'bag', 'left', 'greet', 'locat', 'pretti', 'clean', 'staff', 'pretti', 'friendli', 'well', 'never', 'realli', 'nice', 'employe', 'came', 'explain', 'whole', 'shebang', 'us', 'simpl', 'enough', 'grab', 'bag', 'size', 'want', 'choos', 'base', 'sandwich', 'got', 'cubano', 'choos', 'fixin', 'littl', 'hear', 'desiresher', 'sort', 'start', 'go', 'littl', 'hill', 'six', 'us', 'know', 'big', 'order', 'look', 'like', 'pretti', 'organ', 'line', 'actual', 'manufactur', 'sandwich', 'took', 'lot', 'longer', 'sandwich', 'made', 'thought', 'minut', 'one', 'two', 'sandwich', 'pretti', 'poorli', 'made', 'half', 'ingredi', 'fall', 'pull', 'oili', 'brown', 'paper', 'bag', 'sandwich', 'ask', 'toast', 'warm', 'one', 'side', 'came', 'fridg', 'chain', 'expect', 'werent', 'gourmet', 'melt', 'anyth', 'also', 'dous', 'strong', 'mustard', 'sandwich', 'one', 'spot', 'nice', 'shock', 'tast', 'budsil', 'probabl', 'return', 'anoth', 'wich', 'wich', 'time', 'mayb', 'one', 'live', 'wasnt', 'worst', 'place', 'ive', 'ever']

Yes it is a landmark in Madison but it wasn't nearly up to the hype that I heard about it. It is a fun little place for a small concert and the drinks are reasonably priced but the set up with the stadium type steps were not doing it for me. When it is crowded, for some reason, people think it is ok to bring tables into the walk-ways so you end up standing in one place for a long time just to take your drink back to where you were previously. As for the decor, Fantastic. It makes you feel as though you are in a mini opera hall and the upper balcony is exclusive and makes you feel like a VIP. In fact you have to be...

I work just down the road from this place and frequent here enough for them to know me on a first-name basis. They are always OUTRAGEOUSLY fast which is great on a 30 min lunch break. The place is always clean and quiet and they are always really polite here. The sandwiches never taste stale or like the ingredients have been sitting out for a while unlike some of these locations.

It is a little small for it;s location in my opinion but I have never had to wait very long even if it were packed wall to wall here. When I don't have time to leave work, sometimes I have them delivered. They come right out and have only ONCE ever taken longer than 30 minutes to get to me.

Honestly though the burritos and other various menu items seem to be made with high quality ingredients, quickly, and for a reasonable price. It is some pretty good football game food after a few beers. 

I would have to say that although I KNOW the food is good, to people walking by it may sort of seem like a dump.

It was really really nice. There is not a lot of parking so be careful and also if you need to park elsewhere, be careful where you park. You walk in through these massive doors where you are greeted by the hostess' to take you to your seat. Because we had a reservation we were seated immediately. They have nice wood-like tables and some pretty comfy leather chairs as your seating. The decor is pretty nice but a bit bland in my opinion. They seemed to just put their logo wherever they could fit it with one little decoration above the kitchen window that was pretty nice. They do have fireplaces, and being called Bonfyre, you might expect they would haha! 

The food was pretty good and reasonably priced but a little pricey for some of the simpler things like a wrap or a sandwich. Drinks? Expensive... Very... no matter what you get, from PBR to Champagne it was just weirdly expensive. Everyone had seemed to hype this place up a lot which in my opinion was... respectable but not entirely as ""Miraculous"" as it was made out to be. It almost made me think of P.F. Chang's. It just sort of seems like one of those places that is new and exclusive but pushing to be a chain. The one thing I do respect was their menu, which our server informed us is changed slightly every two months. This was impressive because it means you could have a different experience every time you go and I like that... A LOT. 

Exterior? Bland with tinted windows which makes it difficult to see if the place is busy or worth going. It is also located off the belt-line in Madison which makes it a nice eye-catcher but nothing to see except the sign.

So here is the thing that everybody needs to know about Brews Brothers or what I want you to know... When you think of Brew Brothers, don't think gourmet meal or anything. 

Think, awesome burger and great beer with your friends after work and just letting the aches and pains of the day run through you like your 20oz beer does. Now for Wisconsinites, here is why it is fantastic; BEER. Beer, beer and more beer. There are so many beer choices and GOOD beer choices that it takes me literally 5-10 minutes to decide. It's cheap, plentiful, and delicious and there is a beer there for everybody (including cider for those not bold enough). The food is better than I expected and REALLY good for a place, that I like to call, ""a dive-chain."" What do you mean Colin?! You're not making any sense! Well I mean, Brews Brothers is in fact a chain. It's not a LARGE chain, with only two locations, but in the sense of the word it is. 

Now the reason I call it a dive-chain is because it really isn't taking itself too seriously. They really make you feel hey, grab a couple beers, have a burger, laugh with your friends, and we'll see you next week. They exhibit their beers in front of you as you walk up to the bar as if it were a museum or parade of beer and it is something to be marveled at. So many beer taps striving for your attention. The greasy smell of burgers attacking your nose urging you to have one. It is simply a relaxing place to go. Staff? INCREDIBLY friendly and really make you feel like a regular. Now for those who know my posts etc. They know I love it when a place makes you feel as though you've never left and thats exactly how they make you feel. 

Now I REALLY really want to give this 5 stars but there are two big things that are nagging me. The first is the location, it is in sort of an odd place which is in between a sub shop and salad shop with a Yoga studio upstairs in a strip mall. It would be great if they were lucky enough to have a stand alone building but, such is life. The second is that I feel in this age and in Madison, even a beer bar needs to offer some liquor. I have had friends join me at this wonderful spot to be really disappointed that they didn't offer any sort of liquor. They settled for cider (simply because they don't drink beer) which is crazy to most but I understood it.\

Simply put by their own slogan (on the back of their shirts, and yes, one that I bought...)

I will say that their selection is not the greatest here, it seems to be more Desks and Office chairs than anything. All the electronics are either not there or broken, but everything else is ok. Things are clean and organized and you don't have to go on a scavenger hunt for anything. Well laid out store so you don't feel pressured into other isles. 

Now the kicker to this place is the staff in my opinion. They are anything but helpful. Although I never asked a question or anything they were very concerned with their plans for the weekend and other work related drama when I arrived and departed. Not once did anyone ask if they could help me find something or if there was something particular I was looking for. You could here them talking and laughing from the back of the store which, i'm all for good fun at work but when you are that loud in a large store which customers are looking for something and just hear you laughing somewhere?

Every time I am in here (which seems to be every week) I seem to find something. Now, I will say that this location does seem to be understaffed most of the time so I will agree with Corey on the matter that it takes a while before you can talk to someone. However, I feel that once you find someone they are extremely helpful, at least in my experiences. They are always willing to find you the size you need and haven't taken too long to grab shoes or anything from the back.

I will say over the holiday season they are a bit better but that is to be expected. Finally, It can get a little messy in here when it is busy but again they seem to be understaffed which I feel for. I have actually seen one person consistently working here for about 2 years now and it seems like they never get a day off.

This is by-far my favorite place to go on a slower night rather than the party scene. Go in there have a few delicious exotic beers and talk to some down-right friendly people.

There is one thing I would like to touch on about this particular location and that is; its location. It is in a great place near a lot of cool places in Fitchburg. Fitchburg isn't the biggest city in the world but we endure! My favorite thing is that it is right near a Great Dane Pub and it is in the same strip-mall area as a Starbucks so after a little dinner you can go grab a cup of coffee or a beer! The staff at this location are also always so nice and always have a lot of energy, they are quick with bringing food out and very respectful.

It is a nice establishment with a warming sense when you go there. I have been here twice for 2 concerts and they were OK. The most recent one was for Rusko which was spectacular. The older-style seats, floor, and stage with a couple of nice modern things thrown in to give it an updated feel. They have a second upper level which is sort of oddly proportioned and designed. It almost goes straight up so that people on the second level can have a view of the stage but it is very steep. So if you are intoxicated, I suggest staying on the first level... Furthermore the bar and drinks here are actually better priced than most concert places... It was $4 for a 16oz PBR which ya... It's PBR but for $4? Can't go wrong! The acoustics are pretty good but could be better because sound doesn't carry well in there for some reason. Also the bathrooms in the basement are absolutely disgusting and for some reason they always allow girls to come into the men's room if the women's is full... I think that is highly inappropriate and there needs to be new management or staff to help solidify that problem. Finally, people who attend this place are extremely rude, intoxicated or not they just flat out are.	0	0	0	['realli', 'enjoy', 'orpheum', 'theater', 'rich', 'madison', 'histori', 'import', 'nice', 'establish', 'warm', 'sens', 'go', 'twice', 'concert', 'ok', 'recent', 'one', 'rusko', 'spectacular', 'olderstyl', 'seat', 'floor', 'stage', 'coupl', 'nice', 'modern', 'thing', 'thrown', 'give', 'updat', 'feel', 'second', 'upper', 'level', 'sort', 'oddli', 'proport', 'design', 'almost', 'goe', 'straight', 'peopl', 'second', 'level', 'view', 'stage', 'steep', 'intox', 'suggest', 'stay', 'first', 'level', 'furthermor', 'bar', 'drink', 'actual', 'better', 'price', 'concert', 'place', 'oz', 'pbr', 'ya', 'pbr', 'cant', 'go', 'wrong', 'acoust', 'pretti', 'good', 'could', 'better', 'sound', 'doesnt', 'carri', 'well', 'reason', 'also', 'bathroom', 'basement', 'absolut', 'disgust', 'reason', 'alway', 'allow', 'girl', 'come', 'men', 'room', 'women', 'full', 'think', 'highli', 'inappropri', 'need', 'new', 'manag', 'staff', 'help', 'solidifi', 'problem', 'final', 'peopl', 'attend', 'place', 'extrem', 'rude', 'intox', 'flat']

They have EVERYTHING here. Legends is kind of tucked away near the West Towne mall and the next most recognizable thing nearby is a Chucky Cheese. Straight away the only qualm I have with the place is the parking lot. Not enough parking what-so-ever. Not the end of the world though. You walk in through a corner entrance to reveal a huge wrap-around bar with TONS of tables and stools surrounding it.

There is a huge screen at the front along with dart boards to get you started on the Sports bar feel. Pool table in the opposing corner with a few slots as well. Now the kickers of this place. First the big screen at the front? That is mainly reserved for very large UFC fights!!!! YES one of very few bars in Madison will show them because of how costly they are to show. Can't get a great view of the screen? don't worry. They have probably over 15 other TV's surrounding the bar attached to the ceiling. I am not exaggerating one bit. You can't escape a TV in this place even if you wanted to. Which is awesome because they show pretty much every kind of sport known to man. The outdoor patio on the side if large and plentiful of seating where they still play the audio for games and yet you still have a clear view inside the window at current games.

Head around to the back of the bar and there is a full-size volley ball court! Leagues and all. The other immediate thing you will notice is the awesome new Tiki Shack bar they HAND BUILT with a large (around 50"") TV mounted against the wall. They don't stock a ton back there but another pitcher of mediocre beer? Sure! They have bean bag boards and sometimes some special events like $1 Cheese burgers and not too long ago they even had a full-size lamb cooking back there! IT WAS DELICIOUS. They also have live music back there sometimes with a little stage in the corner, no real big names or anything but more than what any other kind of place would have.

Most importantly, the employees and the family that owns this place is spectacular. They make you feel like a regular even if this is your first time there. If your a regular you feel like family. The owner of this place is always genuinely concerned with how you might be doing and how you are in his company and the establishment. If not my favorite #1 bar it is a very close second but I might be brave and say it is.

I have shopped here a couple different times and it seems every time has been different. Times I have gone in and never been helped when obviously looking for something, other times there have been a surplus of employees. 

Men's department is slight compared to the women's department which is ok I guess but a little disappointing considering the other Gap is in the West Towne mall which is Miles away. Store is always very clean and the dressing rooms are empty without clutter almost every time I have been there. They have a great AD behind the registers which is bright and can sort of just boost your mood... until you walk up to it and it gives you a migraine.

The main reason for the 3 Star rating is simply lack of selection for men. Although like I said the women's section is plentiful and likely makes up the difference in that.

You pass some quaint outdoor seating and enter into a somewhat confusing maze to find some of the main seating and the bar. Rich wood surrounding you as it melts you into relaxation before you even reach the bar at the back of the establishment. You explore this tightly packed place by walking down some stairs to another bar, which I am going to call ""the speak easy"" with white lounge seating in an intimate space that exudes class. Candles lit and people chatting.

Coming back upstairs, My buddy and I had some cocktails and steak sandwiches in what I call the ""Middle Al Capone room"" The reason I say that is because I imagine Al Capone sitting in the corner of this all wood room underneath the small little wall lamps with a stogie and a cognac relaxing after a hard day of moonshine running... Soothing lighting throughout with small intimate booths with some close friends. This is it... Probably going to be my new favorite place...."	4	3	4	['ok', 'went', 'first', 'time', 'night', 'actual', 'late', 'night', 'menu', 'honest', 'never', 'write', 'review', 'base', 'one', 'visit', 'peopl', 'oh', 'dear', 'god', 'let', 'paint', 'word', 'pictur', 'peopl', 'walk', 'littl', 'holeinthewal', 'type', 'place', 'drawn', 'like', 'moth', 'light', 'huge', 'white', 'awn', 'street', 'pass', 'quaint', 'outdoor', 'seat', 'enter', 'somewhat', 'confus', 'maze', 'find', 'main', 'seat', 'bar', 'rich', 'wood', 'surround', 'melt', 'relax', 'even', 'reach', 'bar', 'back', 'establish', 'explor', 'tightli', 'pack', 'place', 'walk', 'stair', 'anoth', 'bar', 'go', 'call', 'speak', 'easi', 'white', 'loung', 'seat', 'intim', 'space', 'exud', 'class', 'candl', 'lit', 'peopl', 'chattingcom', 'back', 'upstair', 'buddi', 'cocktail', 'steak', 'sandwich', 'call', 'middl', 'al', 'capon', 'room', 'reason', 'say', 'imagin', 'al', 'capon', 'sit', 'corner', 'wood', 'room', 'underneath', 'small', 'littl', 'wall', 'lamp', 'stogi', 'cognac', 'relax', 'hard', 'day', 'moonshin', 'run', 'sooth', 'light', 'throughout', 'small', 'intim', 'booth', 'close', 'friend', 'probabl', 'go', 'new', 'favorit', 'place']

I hate to say that but they pretty much are. Similar layout, similar products, similar prices. As a matter of fact some products are identical to the others but with different branding but I think the same Chinese factory makes the same product for all the companies. I digress... This particular location is seated well between West Towne Wall but closer the West Gate Mall. They have the standard thingamabobs and doodads for all your office needs at, in my opinion, probably the cheapest in the city. They actually have a little bigger selection than their competitors but I think that is based on sheer age of the company. Office Depot has been around since I can remember and was ALWAYS the first stop for school supplies.

So, the company has been around forever and they have the cheapest prices in town you say? So Colin, why only 3 stars then?! WELL ILL TELL YA... (dramatic effect) I give a three star rating for essentially one reason. Lack Of Change. This Office Depot hasn't changed since I was a wee-little-lad back in first grade. I just don't understand how a company expects to move forward if they are not willing to Market themselves. I have not seen any advertisements or bilboards for Office Depot in a very long time and can't imagine they're doing very well. I know that it might seem that that would reflect more on the company as a whole than a particular store but why isn't that store pushing harder to market themselves?

As most of my friends and readers on Yelp will realize about me that I enjoy the future very much and where we are going. Not particularly where we have been. In some situation its good to remain where you are and that's the spirit and charm of some places. Not however, for a company that sells technology products and business related items.

The store itself? Clean, organized, staff is excellent, but a little crowded entry way."	1	0	0	['anoth', 'offic', 'suppli', 'store', 'say', 'frankli', 'hate', 'say', 'pretti', 'much', 'similar', 'layout', 'similar', 'product', 'similar', 'price', 'matter', 'fact', 'product', 'ident', 'other', 'differ', 'brand', 'think', 'chines', 'factori', 'make', 'product', 'compani', 'digress', 'particular', 'locat', 'seat', 'well', 'west', 'town', 'wall', 'closer', 'west', 'gate', 'mall', 'standard', 'thingamabob', 'doodad', 'offic', 'need', 'opinion', 'probabl', 'cheapest', 'citi', 'actual', 'littl', 'bigger', 'select', 'competitor', 'think', 'base', 'sheer', 'age', 'compani', 'offic', 'depot', 'around', 'sinc', 'rememb', 'alway', 'first', 'stop', 'school', 'suppliesso', 'compani', 'around', 'forev', 'cheapest', 'price', 'town', 'say', 'colin', 'star', 'well', 'ill', 'tell', 'ya', 'dramat', 'effect', 'give', 'three', 'star', 'rate', 'essenti', 'one', 'reason', 'lack', 'chang', 'offic', 'depot', 'hasnt', 'chang', 'sinc', 'weelittlelad', 'back', 'first', 'grade', 'dont', 'understand', 'compani', 'expect', 'move', 'forward', 'will', 'market', 'seen', 'advertis', 'bilboard', 'offic', 'depot', 'long', 'time', 'cant', 'imagin', 'theyr', 'well', 'know', 'might', 'seem', 'would', 'reflect', 'compani', 'whole', 'particular', 'store', 'isnt', 'store', 'push', 'harder', 'market', 'themselvesa', 'friend', 'reader', 'yelp', 'realiz', 'enjoy', 'futur', 'much', 'go', 'particularli', 'situat', 'good', 'remain', 'that', 'spirit', 'charm', 'place', 'howev', 'compani', 'sell', 'technolog', 'product', 'busi', 'relat', 'itemsth', 'store', 'clean', 'organ', 'staff', 'excel', 'littl', 'crowd', 'entri', 'way']

You walk over to a glass-encased ""room"" for the modern-age escalators and stainless steel stairs. They have all the same amenities as other super Targets, such as a cafe, a Starbucks, deli, etc. It of course was extremely clean (seeing that it had just opened) as you would expect.

They have every type of breakfast food under the sun. Omlets and Pancakes, to Crepes O Chocolat. You can build your own or get something standard. It's in kind of in a hidden area so you gotta know where it is. Furthermore this place does get pretty busy for sunday brunch or brunch in general.

This particular location has a lot going for it and some not so much. The things I like most about it, is the location and the interior. This location is found right smack dab on the corner of Fish Hatchery Road and Park Street which is a HUGELY traveled intersection near downtown Madison. Plenty of sitting space, some comfy chairs and even a darkened area that seems... I don't know, quaint. It isn't super busy every time I have been here but it isn't dead either. Staff has been sometimes inattentive and once or twice downright rude but it only happened once or twice so I won't hold it against them. They also have an internet area in the back I think. I tend to stay toward the front of the store so I am not sure but I thought that was a really nice addition. 9 out of 10 times the store is spotless and finally it isn't cramped.

Now onto some not so nice things (Sad Face). So the things I dislike most about this location are 1. the bathroom, and yes I know it seems mundane but if you read some of my other reviews this can make or break it. It isn't always as clean as it could be to put it nicely. 

Another issue I have, Ironically enough, is the location. I know I said I enjoy the location and I do but it is right on the main drag so if you are there on a nice summers day or around 8:00, 12:00, or 4-6:00, all you will see is bustling traffic. Which, if you are trying to relax, is not the first thing that springs to mind. The other issue is that it doesn't seem to be as busy as it should be for being where it is. Why isn't that place packed all day! The reason I have found for this is that there is not much parking without walking a bit, which is great in the summer maybe or if your younger, but not so much in the winter. There is street parking but it is regulated so much that you would end up moving your car anyway. They have about 6 spots along the back of store but thats it.

So because I love their coffee and atmosphere so much this place gets a difficult 5 stars. The reason if because I don't want to have to park on a greatly busy street and cleanliness of the bathroom. Otherwise? Great staff, Free WiFi, Great coffee, Great Decor, Great Food, And Great Coffee... Oh did I say they had Great coffee too?"	0	0	0	['sooo', 'barriqu', 'may', 'know', 'freakin', 'love', 'barriqu', 'must', 'hold', 'excit', 'review', 'particular', 'locat', 'though', 'barriqu', 'coffe', 'tea', 'treat', 'excellentthi', 'particular', 'locat', 'lot', 'go', 'much', 'thing', 'like', 'locat', 'interior', 'locat', 'found', 'right', 'smack', 'dab', 'corner', 'fish', 'hatcheri', 'road', 'park', 'street', 'huge', 'travel', 'intersect', 'near', 'downtown', 'madison', 'plenti', 'sit', 'space', 'comfi', 'chair', 'even', 'darken', 'area', 'seem', 'dont', 'know', 'quaint', 'isnt', 'super', 'busi', 'everi', 'time', 'isnt', 'dead', 'either', 'staff', 'sometim', 'inattent', 'twice', 'downright', 'rude', 'happen', 'twice', 'wont', 'hold', 'also', 'internet', 'area', 'back', 'think', 'tend', 'stay', 'toward', 'front', 'store', 'sure', 'thought', 'realli', 'nice', 'addit', 'time', 'store', 'spotless', 'final', 'isnt', 'crampednow', 'onto', 'nice', 'thing', 'sad', 'face', 'thing', 'dislik', 'locat', 'bathroom', 'ye', 'know', 'seem', 'mundan', 'read', 'review', 'make', 'break', 'isnt', 'alway', 'clean', 'could', 'put', 'nice', 'anoth', 'issu', 'iron', 'enough', 'locat', 'know', 'said', 'enjoy', 'locat', 'right', 'main', 'drag', 'nice', 'summer', 'day', 'around', 'see', 'bustl', 'traffic', 'tri', 'relax', 'first', 'thing', 'spring', 'mind', 'issu', 'doesnt', 'seem', 'busi', 'isnt', 'place', 'pack', 'day', 'reason', 'found', 'much', 'park', 'without', 'walk', 'bit', 'great', 'summer', 'mayb', 'younger', 'much', 'winter', 'street', 'park', 'regul', 'much', 'would', 'end', 'move', 'car', 'anyway', 'spot', 'along', 'back', 'store', 'that', 'itso', 'love', 'coffe', 'atmospher', 'much', 'place', 'get', 'difficult', 'star', 'reason', 'dont', 'want', 'park', 'greatli', 'busi', 'street', 'cleanli', 'bathroom', 'otherwis', 'great', 'staff', 'free', 'wifi', 'great', 'coffe', 'great', 'decor', 'great', 'food', 'great', 'coffe', 'oh', 'say', 'great', 'coffe']

I am completely dissatisfied with this place. It is called a lounge and when you walk in it looks and acts like one. It has really nice accent lighting that calms you down and prepares you for a fun night. Until you see all the broskis and college type clientele. 

Now don't get me wrong I understand this is downtown and college kids like the place and all but it is a lounge. Even the staff is dressed pretty well to make it feel like a really classy place. The establishment is deceivingly small and they make it seem 10X bigger by using large mirrors on the walls but you realize quickly that the place is small, at least on the lower level... The reason I address this is because every time I have been here they had the upstairs closed for some unknown reason. When I asked the ""bouncer"" why it was closed he said it is only for when they are really busy, while I was being shoved around because everyone was shoulder to shoulder and on a saturday night... 

The bartenders are inattentive and thats being kind, they are just shouting at all their friends and buddies who come in and give them special treatment even though I had been sitting there for about 20 minutes, NO that is not an exaggeration. When they come back with their friends' drinks they blatantly try handing shots over me and spilling on me. They apologize but don't offer anything in return and STILL WALK AWAY. The last time I was there and this happened I yelled at the bartender to get my beer and get the manager. The manager gave me my beer and a shot for free but this almost offends me. I am not easily bought like the rest of the drunken people there and I don't expect free stuff. Of course I didn't get another drink for a while after that but that's why I left $2 for my over $40 tab. Some might think it is rude but what are you really tipping those people for? More people tip better at the bar than at a restaurant... Who is doing more work? A server? or some person who literally makes 3 movements to hand you something... 

Probably do not plan on returning to this place unless there is minimal people."	9	0	0	['coupl', 'time', 'final', 'write', 'review', 'complet', 'dissatisfi', 'place', 'call', 'loung', 'walk', 'look', 'act', 'like', 'one', 'realli', 'nice', 'accent', 'light', 'calm', 'prepar', 'fun', 'night', 'see', 'broski', 'colleg', 'type', 'clientel', 'dont', 'get', 'wrong', 'understand', 'downtown', 'colleg', 'kid', 'like', 'place', 'loung', 'even', 'staff', 'dress', 'pretti', 'well', 'make', 'feel', 'like', 'realli', 'classi', 'place', 'establish', 'deceivingli', 'small', 'make', 'seem', 'x', 'bigger', 'use', 'larg', 'mirror', 'wall', 'realiz', 'quickli', 'place', 'small', 'least', 'lower', 'level', 'reason', 'address', 'everi', 'time', 'upstair', 'close', 'unknown', 'reason', 'ask', 'bouncer', 'close', 'said', 'realli', 'busi', 'shove', 'around', 'everyon', 'shoulder', 'shoulder', 'saturday', 'night', 'bartend', 'inattent', 'that', 'kind', 'shout', 'friend', 'buddi', 'come', 'give', 'special', 'treatment', 'even', 'though', 'sit', 'minut', 'exagger', 'come', 'back', 'friend', 'drink', 'blatantli', 'tri', 'hand', 'shot', 'spill', 'apolog', 'dont', 'offer', 'anyth', 'return', 'still', 'walk', 'away', 'last', 'time', 'happen', 'yell', 'bartend', 'get', 'beer', 'get', 'manag', 'manag', 'gave', 'beer', 'shot', 'free', 'almost', 'offend', 'easili', 'bought', 'like', 'rest', 'drunken', 'peopl', 'dont', 'expect', 'free', 'stuff', 'cours', 'didnt', 'get', 'anoth', 'drink', 'that', 'left', 'tab', 'might', 'think', 'rude', 'realli', 'tip', 'peopl', 'peopl', 'tip', 'better', 'bar', 'restaur', 'work', 'server', 'person', 'liter', 'make', 'movement', 'hand', 'someth', 'probabl', 'plan', 'return', 'place', 'unless', 'minim', 'peopl']

Just on the way into Verona it is situated to your right (depending where you are coming from) and parking is nothing but extensive.

I have never had a bad experience here. I have come here for every little item I needed done and have never felt cheated or had the blanket pulled over my eyes. There have been a few things where I was expecting a HUGE bill for things like the stabilizer for my rear suspension that had been slightly bent. I bought a new one and brought it in thinking well Labor will be $100. Zimbrick got me right in, said it would take an hour, had it out in half an hour and didn't charge me a dime. Another time I have come in expecting to replace all my breaks and rotors and Zimbrick saved me about $300 without having to replace everything. 

I have worked with a few guys here and they have ALL been extremely professional and treated me like family. The guy I usually go to even just chats with me about cars and such while i'm having service done. (Mainly getting my oil changed). The facility itself is nothing less than perfection, in my opinion, when it comes to dealerships. It is clean, well layed out, they have a great lounge with a Big Screen TV, leather chairs, FREE WIFI, and the best of all... Free Starbucks Coffee. I have had nothing but great experiences from Zimbrick and not just Zimbrick Acura. However, BECAUSE of Zimbrick Acura I expect to buy another Acura and stay with them for a VERY very long time. Thank you Zimbrick Acura! YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST OF THE BEST.

P.S. When I was having major service done they let me choose what I wanted to drive while I waited for the day.  NOBODY does that.

I have been here 3 times now and it is still by far the best place I have ever eaten. It has a great modern-age atmosphere with even better food! Located right on top of the Overture Center in downtown Madison, you can pretty much see Madison in all its glory! Their food is amazing and made-to-order, even the smallest of details. Also, the bread they bring out is simply the best in the world (to me at least haha) it is perfectly warm and buttery and easily comes apart with a slight tug.

It has great spacious seats, lots of places to eat and grab some beer, and lots of bathrooms. The downsides is that it could be a bit (population wise) bigger. It seems like it doesn't hold that many people but maybe it is the design. The flooring itself is quite interesting I have found as it is an ice arena that is maintained year round even when basketball is played on top of it!	0	0	0	['love', 'place', 'stateoftheart', 'home', 'lot', 'sport', 'uwmadison', 'great', 'spaciou', 'seat', 'lot', 'place', 'eat', 'grab', 'beer', 'lot', 'bathroom', 'downsid', 'could', 'bit', 'popul', 'wise', 'bigger', 'seem', 'like', 'doesnt', 'hold', 'mani', 'peopl', 'mayb', 'design', 'floor', 'quit', 'interest', 'found', 'ice', 'arena', 'maintain', 'year', 'round', 'even', 'basketbal', 'play', 'top']

The hotel rooms were very nice, as well as the lobby and seminar rooms. Their ball room is also very nice. It is close to downtown for easy access for the night life. (I know because i'm from Madison). Our organization made it a little rowdy but it was still fun. The staff is also excellent and responded to our requests and needs very fast and with courtesy. I will absolutely recommend this hotel to anyone who is coming to Madison.	0	0	0	['hotel', 'eleg', 'feel', 'organ', 'confer', 'lot', 'fun', 'hotel', 'room', 'nice', 'well', 'lobbi', 'seminar', 'room', 'ball', 'room', 'also', 'nice', 'close', 'downtown', 'easi', 'access', 'night', 'life', 'know', 'im', 'madison', 'organ', 'made', 'littl', 'rowdi', 'still', 'fun', 'staff', 'also', 'excel', 'respond', 'request', 'need', 'fast', 'courtesi', 'absolut', 'recommend', 'hotel', 'anyon', 'come', 'madison']

Clean, Tidy, etc. It is tucked away in a bit of an industrial area which is kind of nice cause there isn't a lot of traffic then! And I used to run to Pinnacle. The building itself is very nice looking and the inside even better! I love the little bar-code key entry thing for members. The staff? Unbelievably nice, they are so kind and want you to have a great experience when you come in which is awesome. Their locker rooms, well as far as the men's one goes, are kept very clean and are maintained all during the day. There is never a shortage of fresh towels, the equipment is sprayed down to again keep cleanliness and you notice right away! Sometimes you can smell the cleanliness. Yep! Finally, it does get a little crowded here around 6-8 because everyone is getting off work. It isn't a huge deal because everyone is pretty generous and kind about allowing someone to get on a unit. I think the price per month is not bad if you really use it like a fitness club is supposed to be used. Also their pool area is really nice as well, they have lots of lanes and it is never crowded they even have a nice hot tub! And a sauna to sweat out all the toxins from the weekend Haha! JK. Overall, a great fitness center.	1	0	0	['love', 'place', 'move', 'alway', 'well', 'kept', 'clean', 'tidi', 'etc', 'tuck', 'away', 'bit', 'industri', 'area', 'kind', 'nice', 'caus', 'isnt', 'lot', 'traffic', 'use', 'run', 'pinnacl', 'build', 'nice', 'look', 'insid', 'even', 'better', 'love', 'littl', 'barcod', 'key', 'entri', 'thing', 'member', 'staff', 'unbeliev', 'nice', 'kind', 'want', 'great', 'experi', 'come', 'awesom', 'locker', 'room', 'well', 'far', 'men', 'one', 'goe', 'kept', 'clean', 'maintain', 'day', 'never', 'shortag', 'fresh', 'towel', 'equip', 'spray', 'keep', 'cleanli', 'notic', 'right', 'away', 'sometim', 'smell', 'cleanli', 'yep', 'final', 'get', 'littl', 'crowd', 'around', 'everyon', 'get', 'work', 'isnt', 'huge', 'deal', 'everyon', 'pretti', 'gener', 'kind', 'allow', 'someon', 'get', 'unit', 'think', 'price', 'per', 'month', 'bad', 'realli', 'use', 'like', 'fit', 'club', 'suppos', 'use', 'also', 'pool', 'area', 'realli', 'nice', 'well', 'lot', 'lane', 'never', 'crowd', 'even', 'nice', 'hot', 'tub', 'sauna', 'sweat', 'toxin', 'weekend', 'haha', 'jk', 'overal', 'great', 'fit', 'center']

I was here for a friends company shin-dig where it was a $10 cover for a movie and live band! The drink prices were cheap and if you bought a mixed drink it wasn't a drop of alcohol and the rest coke or something. IT WAS STRONG! It has great decorations like the wild west or something which was really cool! It made you really feel like you were in a Saloon! as ttam f. said, yeah they did kind of hide the door and you wouldn't notice it unless you were looking for it. When you walk in you are greeted by an open area with the main bar to your left and a secondary bar to your right.

They have an upper ""balcony"" or terrace type thing looking down onto the main floor which was really cool. It was almost like a little getaway area. Beer selection? Extensive with some of the most interesting types of beers i have tasted in a while. They also have 1 pool table along with a dart board and some sort of video game... There was also some type of game in the right corner as you walk in but I cannot remember what. They have a jukebox there but from the looks of it, it seems to be a decoration but who knows.

This place was a lot of fun, relatively small compared to other places like it but great acoustics and oh, kind of a weird thing to add but extremely clean bathrooms! For some reason it was like entering a different world walking into the bathroom like it was part of a very nice restaurant or something but that is a good thing! The one bad thing about this place as far as my experience went, were some very... Distinguished people who really weren't concerned with your personal space or whether they bump into you or not but they were quick to spin around and say excuse me. To sum it all up?

I do not like this store at all though. I have been here about 5 times in total and each time they have something intriguing in the window so I have a peak in side. The store is the size of a walk-in closet and everything is completely overpriced. The selection is awful and most things seem to be made out of cardboard. The staff are unhelpful completely and seem to only be there for some great discounts and a paycheck.  Sometimes you can find a Gem in here but then you see the price tag and have to go sell your car. I can't see anyone except for a celebrity shopping here and justifying the price they would pay.  

Again, I am all for some expensive clothing if you feel great in it, for example for men's jeans maybe $200 tops and they had better be spectacular and last for decades. NOT however $560 and feel like you might put on tarmac. I will continue to give this place my attention but if they don't change something they won't sell anything.

What can I say about this particular location... hmmm well there is generally plenty of parking! Um, what else. Oh and stuff is usually pretty easy to find. But my god, what a disgusting establishment. This location could learn a thing or two from the super Walmart just a couple of miles away. Staff is LESS than helpful, even though things are easy to find they are just strewn about on the shelves, the bathrooms are awful, and the overall feeling of the store is unclean.

Well this is right at the west towne mall and they it is massive. They have something for every single sport you can think of. The thing I really like about the place is that it is always really well kept. Not really a lot of clothes scattered everywhere; no equipment just sitting on the ground or anything.

The lanes have been kept up very well! They also have an arcade in the building as well as a bar for lanes or an entire bar for just bar goers! That is pretty gosh-darn nifty! The bar is a little more towny and also has karaoke on some nights (Friday night when I was there) but they have a cool loft with 2 pool tables and 2 dart boards. It was a lot of fun!

Everyone working here is always really really nice and just so polite. They seem to know everything about everything and are always eager to help.

It's no different and NOW THEY HAVE REMODELED!! 

REI's West Towne location is now massive beacon of your outdooring needs. As many people probably know that REI is aimed a little more toward the more serious and extreme outdoorsman. Including things such as winter camping and mountain climbing. They have a lot of other stuff for everyone though. The new building is gorgeous and one of my favorite features of it is the massive front doors and Ice picks for door handles. You get an immediate feeling that you are about to embark on an outdoor adventure and don't know when you may return. I feel that the combination of the new store and the relaxed personalities of the employees excite you to buy everything and go out into the wilderness and see where you end up. It is fantastic. I have never had a bad experience here and I really hope not to. Everything here is very well separated and categorized you know exactly ""what department"" you are in without knowing you have ever transitioned into another area of expertise.

It can get obnoxiously busy around bar time when about 100 drunk people sprint to this place. yes Madisonian's understand why, because Ian's is SPECTACULAR! They practically have any type of pizza that you want. The other thing is that they area reasonably priced too. They may seem like they are a little on the expensive side at $3.40 - $4.50, but I think that is a fair price. The decor and such of this particular location isn't anything special, just some places to eat and get out. Yeah they have the same theme as the Ian's Franchise but it goes un noticed. I'll have to give this location 5 stars mainly because of the employees. They are so kind and make you feel like one of their friends who came over to a barbecue. I have never had a bad experience here because of them, yes that could change but I am hoping not.

Out of the 4 Great Danes in Madison, I think this one is by far the best. It just seems to have more character and life to it. It is really warm when you walk in like you have been a customer for years and the staff treats you just the same. They have an unbelievable knack for crafting beers which are delicious and plentiful. They have a gorgeous balcony with a huge grill and of course taps within a 5ft reach. It is gated to keep those pesky kids out and the drunken fun in!

The Great Dane Fitchburg is always so well kept; it's clean and shiny like it had just opened for the first time. Their food is amazing as well! I have had countless items off the menu so there is no one thing that I like more over another. The seats are massive and envelope you and make you feel like your curled up in a big LazyBoy chair while you eat. Don't forget all the massive TV's to watch the games on! Now the 1 coolest thing about this location? Barry Alvarez people! Yeah! He is here on Thursday nights!

I know that doesn't really have anything to do with the store but that is where the staff comes in. The staff doesn't seemed to be concerned that I may be standing next to a product waiting for a kid to get off a Macbook Pro for example. They just head over, ask if I need any help, I respond by saying well I am trying to check out this (insert product here)... ""Oh alright well let us know if you have any questions"" and before I can respond with one they have disappeared. The store is relatively cleanly and organized but in addition to that, because of all these kids in there, 75% of the products are either broken or ""non-functional.""

This location is ok, it has a very odd line system but it feels really really large. The only real problem that I have with this place is that the Whiskey Jacks Saloon is right next door and their line can go right up to the Qdoba door so you have to walk through a wall of drunken people just to get into the restaraunt.

It is nice but because it is an underground bar, it can get really loud really fast on a busy night. The bathrooms are hidden away in the back and its sort of small.

FISH BOWLS and they are not just silly old, oh a little bit of alcohol, they mean serious business with these things. NOTE: DO NOT DRINK ALONE bad things will happen.

The happy hour prices are pretty awesome and the prices for food is pretty average. The people that work here though are awesome and really make you feel welcome. 

On the other hand, agreeing with what someone else said, there are better burgers for better prices out there and I feel they could have made certain items on the menu a bit more normal? I wonder if that sounds odd because I may just be nitpicking but it seems like some things on the menu are cool and interesting like their PB&J burger but others seem OVER done to try to make them something out of the ordinary. I would have given this place 5 stars but I can't get over the overdone-ness of some items and when it WASNT happy our the drink prices were too expensive.

It is spectacular YEAR ROUND! You head on into the Der Rathskeller for a beer and maybe a burger during the winter and it is just a warming place. In the spring and summer it makes you feel like it is summer! It is great! Then there is the terrace in back on the lake. During the summer they have live music for free and of course a little beer and brat station! IT is fantastic! Being from Madison, this is my absolute favorite place to hang out during the summer, grab some friends and just sit down there and relax, talk about life, goals, downers, everything! It can get a little busy but that just means it is an amazing place right?! Anyone and everyone should have the privilege of going here for a night and see if they don't return a hundred times more.

The people who work here are incredible and are always really helpful when trying to find something. It's a grocery store so I can't say too much but I always love coming here for some reason to get groceries.	1	0	0	['absolut', 'love', 'metcalf', 'mean', 'come', 'doesnt', 'love', 'low', 'groceri', 'cost', 'ton', 'sampl', 'peopl', 'work', 'incred', 'alway', 'realli', 'help', 'tri', 'find', 'someth', 'groceri', 'store', 'cant', 'say', 'much', 'alway', 'love', 'come', 'reason', 'get', 'groceri']

I was not that happy with my experience. It started off excellently by first finding the tires I would like (which I love cars and knew what I was talking about and the sales person knew that straight away) which had to be ordered. No problem, total was $700 put $100 down, done and done. They even had the lowest price of even online for the tires I wanted! 

Now I had a scheduled time to put them on but with the warranty and such I didn't want to put them on too early which would 1. run down the warranty because it is on a mileage basis and 2. I didn't want to wear down the tread of the tires because it hadn't even snowed yet. So I pushed out the install date and it ended up being after the blizzard because as predicted... my norma tires were awful in the snow.

So I asked what the soonest time was to have them installed and took the time. The day arrives and I head in expecting to pay the remaining $600 for the tires. I had even called to confirm that my initial $100 didn't expire or was returned. Sat around and waited for them to finish and was called up to pay the balance. ""Alright your so your total is $700.68"" I said what? that can't be right. 

I told the sales person (same person I dealt with THE FIRST time I came in) that I had just called to confirm my $100 was still on there. He said yeah it is but the rest is $700. I said for what? For the four tires, no waste disposal (since I kept my tires) and the replacement on all four tires. I said I never discussed the replacement plan with anyone nor with the sales person for that matter. He kind of acted dumb and looked at his colleague like ""HUH wonder how that dun got on there"" Which I was not happy about. Come to find out, they do this to almost EVERYONE, they add it onto every sale without telling you because they make a commission off of the sale.

The whole time I was there they were asking each other who was on that sale or who's sale was it? I told the SP I didn't ask for it and don't want it and to take it off. Now I will say the replacement plan is sort of nice a $25 per tire its replaced no matter what happens, nail or pot hole... However its not nice if they don't tell you. In the end the guy covered all four tires for the price of three which I even argued there and hope one tire goes just to even out the cost.

Here are the final parts. I should have mentioned earlier that because of where I work, I got a 10% discount as well off the whole deal but the dollar mounts i'm talking about is with that included. After I purchased the tires and had them installed I later went online to make sure the price hadn't come down on the tires. Which lead me to a rebate page... WHICH MY TIRES QUALIFIED FOR... buy four michelin tires and receive a $70 rebate. I was never told this once while working with my sales person nor by anybody else. I filed for it and got declined for some-odd reason (probably because I filed for the rebate the same day) but ended up calling the corporate office to find out why. The people over the phone were SO sympathetic about the replacement plan and the rebate issue. They approved my rebate Immediately and I received a couple of weeks later. 

Even though it all worked out I still wasn't told about spending an extra $100 for a replacement plan I never asked for, I was never told about the rebate which probably would have inclined me to purchase the replacement plan in full and pretty much got the run-around in store as to why it was on there.

The people seem knowledgable and fast but they will stick you with a nice bill if your not careful. Do some major research before going in there and TELL them ONLY what you need. If you want further information on their ""Extras"" just call or go online. I have been in sales and I will say a sales person will do anything to sell..."	10	1	0	['dealt', 'place', 'get', 'snow', 'tire', 'car', 'winter', 'oh', 'impend', 'blizzard', 'go', 'late', 'errggg', 'say', 'happi', 'experi', 'start', 'excel', 'first', 'find', 'tire', 'would', 'like', 'love', 'car', 'knew', 'talk', 'sale', 'person', 'knew', 'straight', 'away', 'order', 'problem', 'total', 'put', 'done', 'done', 'even', 'lowest', 'price', 'even', 'onlin', 'tire', 'want', 'schedul', 'time', 'put', 'warranti', 'didnt', 'want', 'put', 'earli', 'would', 'run', 'warranti', 'mileag', 'basi', 'didnt', 'want', 'wear', 'tread', 'tire', 'hadnt', 'even', 'snow', 'yet', 'push', 'instal', 'date', 'end', 'blizzard', 'predict', 'norma', 'tire', 'aw', 'snowso', 'ask', 'soonest', 'time', 'instal', 'took', 'time', 'day', 'arriv', 'head', 'expect', 'pay', 'remain', 'tire', 'even', 'call', 'confirm', 'initi', 'didnt', 'expir', 'return', 'sat', 'around', 'wait', 'finish', 'call', 'pay', 'balanc', 'alright', 'total', 'said', 'cant', 'right', 'told', 'sale', 'person', 'person', 'dealt', 'first', 'time', 'came', 'call', 'confirm', 'still', 'said', 'yeah', 'rest', 'said', 'four', 'tire', 'wast', 'dispos', 'sinc', 'kept', 'tire', 'replac', 'four', 'tire', 'said', 'never', 'discuss', 'replac', 'plan', 'anyon', 'sale', 'person', 'matter', 'kind', 'act', 'dumb', 'look', 'colleagu', 'like', 'huh', 'wonder', 'dun', 'got', 'happi', 'come', 'find', 'almost', 'everyon', 'add', 'onto', 'everi', 'sale', 'without', 'tell', 'make', 'commiss', 'saleth', 'whole', 'time', 'ask', 'sale', 'who', 'sale', 'told', 'sp', 'didnt', 'ask', 'dont', 'want', 'take', 'say', 'replac', 'plan', 'sort', 'nice', 'per', 'tire', 'replac', 'matter', 'happen', 'nail', 'pot', 'hole', 'howev', 'nice', 'dont', 'tell', 'end', 'guy', 'cover', 'four', 'tire', 'price', 'three', 'even', 'argu', 'hope', 'one', 'tire', 'goe', 'even', 'costher', 'final', 'part', 'mention', 'earlier', 'work', 'got', 'discount', 'well', 'whole', 'deal', 'dollar', 'mount', 'im', 'talk', 'includ', 'purchas', 'tire', 'instal', 'later', 'went', 'onlin', 'make', 'sure', 'price', 'hadnt', 'come', 'tire', 'lead', 'rebat', 'page', 'tire', 'qualifi', 'buy', 'four', 'michelin', 'tire', 'receiv', 'rebat', 'never', 'told', 'work', 'sale', 'person', 'anybodi', 'els', 'file', 'got', 'declin', 'someodd', 'reason', 'probabl', 'file', 'rebat', 'day', 'end', 'call', 'corpor', 'offic', 'find', 'peopl', 'phone', 'sympathet', 'replac', 'plan', 'rebat', 'issu', 'approv', 'rebat', 'immedi', 'receiv', 'coupl', 'week', 'later', 'even', 'though', 'work', 'still', 'wasnt', 'told', 'spend', 'extra', 'replac', 'plan', 'never', 'ask', 'never', 'told', 'rebat', 'probabl', 'would', 'inclin', 'purchas', 'replac', 'plan', 'full', 'pretti', 'much', 'got', 'runaround', 'store', 'thereth', 'peopl', 'seem', 'knowledg', 'fast', 'stick', 'nice', 'bill', 'care', 'major', 'research', 'go', 'tell', 'need', 'want', 'inform', 'extra', 'call', 'go', 'onlin', 'sale', 'say', 'sale', 'person', 'anyth', 'sell']

Yes it is quite expensive but from what I have purchased from here? It lasts forever... Some of the jeans have larger stitching on the back pockets so it can get snagged on say a wood splinter while sitting a wood bench! Haha. They have a great selection of Graphic Tees and lots of nice button-up shirts. Prices vary on those and so do the brands they carry. They carry a HUGE amount of different brands for Tees. The staff? I can't say as many nice things. They almost act like they are doing you a favor by just letting you in the place...

It is an extremely unique vibe to it with a nifty Koi tank and a nifty asian-sensation bar. This place isn't in the best location in my opinion and you really have to know where it is to attend a night out here. Personally I wish it was more in an obvious place because it really deserves more recognition than it is getting. This gives Fitchburg another cool place to go and relax aside from the Great Dane. 

They have a great outdoor patio that is almost as big as their indoor seating and this is probably the one and only problem that I have with Atmoic Koi. That is the indoor seating, for some reason, in my personal opinion, it seems a bit cramped with not a ton of seating, when you are their on a busy night (friday or saturday) it seems impossible to find a seat. 

Other than that, the atmosphere is spectacular, one of my favorite features is the large wall sculpture of a Koi fish. It isn't true rock but it is made out of concrete I learned from one of the bar tenders which seems to have taken quite a bit of time! This gives such a classy feeling to this spectacular place. They also have a few TV's sometimes that have a cool movie on or some sports games etc... A shuffle board and some darts complete this hidden Fitchburg Gem for one of the greats in the Madison area alone. MORE PEOPLE NEED TO GET IN HERE SO HEAD THERE AND GIVE IT A SHOT! its a blast haha

All together this is definitely a great place to enjoy with a few friends for a quiet night out and some great and reasonably priced drinks."	3	0	1	['one', 'interest', 'water', 'hole', 'ever', 'extrem', 'uniqu', 'vibe', 'nifti', 'koi', 'tank', 'nifti', 'asiansens', 'bar', 'place', 'isnt', 'best', 'locat', 'opinion', 'realli', 'know', 'attend', 'night', 'person', 'wish', 'obviou', 'place', 'realli', 'deserv', 'recognit', 'get', 'give', 'fitchburg', 'anoth', 'cool', 'place', 'go', 'relax', 'asid', 'great', 'dane', 'great', 'outdoor', 'patio', 'almost', 'big', 'indoor', 'seat', 'probabl', 'one', 'problem', 'atmoic', 'koi', 'indoor', 'seat', 'reason', 'person', 'opinion', 'seem', 'bit', 'cramp', 'ton', 'seat', 'busi', 'night', 'friday', 'saturday', 'seem', 'imposs', 'find', 'seat', 'atmospher', 'spectacular', 'one', 'favorit', 'featur', 'larg', 'wall', 'sculptur', 'koi', 'fish', 'isnt', 'true', 'rock', 'made', 'concret', 'learn', 'one', 'bar', 'tender', 'seem', 'taken', 'quit', 'bit', 'time', 'give', 'classi', 'feel', 'spectacular', 'place', 'also', 'tv', 'sometim', 'cool', 'movi', 'sport', 'game', 'etc', 'shuffl', 'board', 'dart', 'complet', 'hidden', 'fitchburg', 'gem', 'one', 'great', 'madison', 'area', 'alon', 'peopl', 'need', 'get', 'head', 'give', 'shot', 'blast', 'hahaal', 'togeth', 'definit', 'great', 'place', 'enjoy', 'friend', 'quiet', 'night', 'great', 'reason', 'price', 'drink']

It is in a fantastic location for a couple of reason 1. It is a great place to grab a quick lunch that isn't flash heated and during work, 2.

I really enjoy sitting around in there with some coffee and some Homework or to just read some magazines. It can get a bit busy with all these other students and Book-readers but that is to be expected. Furthermore, they always have their books and magazines stocked to the gills! It is nice to go in there and know they will have what you are looking for. Finally, I want to explain why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It is the checkout line. For some reason unknown to me, they never seem to want anymore than say 2-3 people at the registers. It ends up being a huge line and the only time I can think of when they have more than 2-3 people is the day after christmas. I digress, it is an all around good store and one of the nicer Barnes and Nobles I have been to.	0	0	0	['well', 'come', 'barn', 'nobl', 'long', 'time', 'yearsonend', 'realli', 'enjoy', 'sit', 'around', 'coffe', 'homework', 'read', 'magazin', 'get', 'bit', 'busi', 'student', 'bookread', 'expect', 'furthermor', 'alway', 'book', 'magazin', 'stock', 'gill', 'nice', 'go', 'know', 'look', 'final', 'want', 'explain', 'gave', 'star', 'instead', 'checkout', 'line', 'reason', 'unknown', 'never', 'seem', 'want', 'anymor', 'say', 'peopl', 'regist', 'end', 'huge', 'line', 'time', 'think', 'peopl', 'day', 'christma', 'digress', 'around', 'good', 'store', 'one', 'nicer', 'barn', 'nobl']

So Menards right away is probably known for having everything under the stars for home improvement and other related products. This location is a little hard to get to but not impossible and is in a relatively good area to strive. As expected they have almost everything I have ever looked for in stock and at a competitive price. Its clean, products are generally clearly marked and are pretty easy to find. Now the reason I gave it a 3 Star review is their staff. Which I feel I should give another chance after reading other review but I'll provide my opinion.

The staff, at least every time I have been here are extremely unhelpful. Not once have I ever been given a for sure ""Yes we have that"" or ""Well let me check""  while I have been searching. They are few and far between and I have been ""suggested"" to look in an area across the store but never taken to an area, said to ask anyone else, or had someone look for something for me. They just use their radios to ask someone who in response just says ""just have them (the customer) look in ' such and such an isle'"".

Specifically to this location, it is expectedly busier than most because it is right on University (hard to miss). Even so there seems to be plentiful seating and staff is efficient give or take some rare occasions. Now the real kicker. This Starbucks has a drive thru! Which is GREAT except that FOR the drive thru is the worst positioned store I have ever seen. People seem to think it is a free-for-all and whoever is closest gets to go; whether you come in through the back entrance or front  I guess its anyones go.

The bartender that was serving me was extremely condescending like it was me who was providing a service. Furthermore the locals were really rowdy and just disrespectful to people who they did not recognize. I even had multiple drinks placed onto my card by other people who were in the establishment and the bartender DID NOT confirm this with me. He just la-dee-da swiped it. I refused to pay and was furious that he would even think that was ok. He said he was going to swipe it anyway because it was on my tab... He decided not to when I offered the possibility of law enforcement to come fix the situation. He didn't as well because it was announced multiple times that there were underage patrons drinking and within the bar.

I have to say that I have met quite a few really nice and kind people who work here and they used to do a spectacular job. I have to say that in the recent year or two they have kind of lacked in good customer service. Let's start with some of the basic things in a review.

The location of this place is pretty great. It is right near the West Towne Mall on Madison's west side and it's in the ""Target Plaza"" where they have a lot of other great shopping. It is RIGHT on Mineral Point road so you can see it right as you pass it. The store itself is well kept and cleanly and is most of the time neatly organized. Always have the latest games, almost never have to wait for stock to come in. The other nice thing about this location being so close to the mall is that there is another Gamestop inside the mall. So if one or the other is out of stock on something usually the other store will have at least one or two in stock. These are some of the great things about this location... However...

Whoever has read my review before will know that I am very concerned with Customer Service. The people who work at an establishment are the biggest deciding factor of whether I will enjoy a place or not. This place used to have some absolutely great employees that were always willing to help, explain the plot of a game. Tell you why you should or shouldn't buy a game, analyze the games that you may currently play and what games coming out you may be interested in. The people working there now just seem to expect you to know what your looking for and to buy it and reserve something else. I also like to give examples so let me give you my last one that seemed to have been the same experience for the last year and a half. 

I just went in here to get rid of some games I no longer play and get some coffee money. I was the only one in the store when I walked in and I was never greeted nor even looked at. So I perused for a moment or two then walked up to the counter to sell my items. As I walked up, 1 of the 2 workers never looked up at me as they walked away and into the back of the store. The other had his back turned to me and was continuing on some other task. I politely said excuse me as the gentleman spun around and said ""oh, the other guy will be right back i'm finishing something right now."" I said alright cause I don't mind waiting, but about 5-10 minutes went by and I was still standing there so I started looking around a bit more when I look back to the counter the person who had his back to me was now on his phone doing nothing. I walked back up and he immediately turned back to ""what he was finishing."" The other employee finally returned and asked if I wanted to sell the games I was holding in my hand. I said yes and he started ringing me out. He immediately asked for my ID and then gave me a receipt for store credit. Now I wouldn't have minded if I wanted to reserve another game or purchase something else in the near future but I rarely play video games anymore.

I said oh I was actually looking for cash and instead of apologizing he very condescendingly said ""Really? you know that's like half of what you have right now"" I said I didn't care because I had all the games I wanted and that I don't play games that much anymore. He sort of rolled his eyes, ""umm... ok?"" he protested... Handed me my cash and didn't say a word so I left. I don't hold this against the store as a whole because I have had pleasant times here but that was outrageous. So hopefully they hire some more spritely and excited people about anyone who comes in. The video game market is not doing so hot so to exile people like that is just hurting it more. Getting people excited about games again is what they are all about! So I will continue shopping here for now but instead of an A-OK rating its more of an eh.... OK... rating."	0	3	0	['come', 'locat', 'ever', 'sinc', 'could', 'play', 'video', 'game', 'pretti', 'much', 'say', 'met', 'quit', 'realli', 'nice', 'kind', 'peopl', 'work', 'use', 'spectacular', 'job', 'say', 'recent', 'year', 'two', 'kind', 'lack', 'good', 'custom', 'servic', 'let', 'start', 'basic', 'thing', 'reviewth', 'locat', 'place', 'pretti', 'great', 'right', 'near', 'west', 'town', 'mall', 'madison', 'west', 'side', 'target', 'plaza', 'lot', 'great', 'shop', 'right', 'miner', 'point', 'road', 'see', 'right', 'pass', 'store', 'well', 'kept', 'cleanli', 'time', 'neatli', 'organ', 'alway', 'latest', 'game', 'almost', 'never', 'wait', 'stock', 'come', 'nice', 'thing', 'locat', 'close', 'mall', 'anoth', 'gamestop', 'insid', 'mall', 'one', 'stock', 'someth', 'usual', 'store', 'least', 'one', 'two', 'stock', 'great', 'thing', 'locat', 'howeverwhoev', 'read', 'review', 'know', 'concern', 'custom', 'servic', 'peopl', 'work', 'establish', 'biggest', 'decid', 'factor', 'whether', 'enjoy', 'place', 'place', 'use', 'absolut', 'great', 'employe', 'alway', 'will', 'help', 'explain', 'plot', 'game', 'tell', 'shouldnt', 'buy', 'game', 'analyz', 'game', 'may', 'current', 'play', 'game', 'come', 'may', 'interest', 'peopl', 'work', 'seem', 'expect', 'know', 'look', 'buy', 'reserv', 'someth', 'els', 'also', 'like', 'give', 'exampl', 'let', 'give', 'last', 'one', 'seem', 'experi', 'last', 'year', 'half', 'went', 'get', 'rid', 'game', 'longer', 'play', 'get', 'coffe', 'money', 'one', 'store', 'walk', 'never', 'greet', 'even', 'look', 'perus', 'moment', 'two', 'walk', 'counter', 'sell', 'item', 'walk', 'worker', 'never', 'look', 'walk', 'away', 'back', 'store', 'back', 'turn', 'continu', 'task', 'polit', 'said', 'excus', 'gentleman', 'spun', 'around', 'said', 'oh', 'guy', 'right', 'back', 'im', 'finish', 'someth', 'right', 'said', 'alright', 'caus', 'dont', 'mind', 'wait', 'minut', 'went', 'still', 'stand', 'start', 'look', 'around', 'bit', 'look', 'back', 'counter', 'person', 'back', 'phone', 'noth', 'walk', 'back', 'immedi', 'turn', 'back', 'finish', 'employe', 'final', 'return', 'ask', 'want', 'sell', 'game', 'hold', 'hand', 'said', 'ye', 'start', 'ring', 'immedi', 'ask', 'id', 'gave', 'receipt', 'store', 'credit', 'wouldnt', 'mind', 'want', 'reserv', 'anoth', 'game', 'purchas', 'someth', 'els', 'near', 'futur', 'rare', 'play', 'video', 'game', 'anymorei', 'said', 'oh', 'actual', 'look', 'cash', 'instead', 'apolog', 'condescendingli', 'said', 'realli', 'know', 'that', 'like', 'half', 'right', 'said', 'didnt', 'care', 'game', 'want', 'dont', 'play', 'game', 'much', 'anymor', 'sort', 'roll', 'eye', 'umm', 'ok', 'protest', 'hand', 'cash', 'didnt', 'say', 'word', 'left', 'dont', 'hold', 'store', 'whole', 'pleasant', 'time', 'outrag', 'hope', 'hire', 'sprite', 'excit', 'peopl', 'anyon', 'come', 'video', 'game', 'market', 'hot', 'exil', 'peopl', 'like', 'hurt', 'get', 'peopl', 'excit', 'game', 'continu', 'shop', 'instead', 'aok', 'rate', 'eh', 'ok', 'rate']

This place is gonna take some describing so bare with me. You enter through a door in the corner of the bar where you first see an ATM (hint hint) and then find some seating to your right and the bar straight ahead. As you walk towards the bar, the place kind of bottlenecks where you find the stairs to an upstairs, the door the outdoor patio and lots of bar height tables. 

The bar is runs almost the length of the building then wraps around a bit near the kitchen. BTW they make some GREAT bar food especially a patty melt that was soo good I ordered it immediately the next time I went. Anywho... They have a TON of draft beers and a TON of different liquors. Great big TV's right at the bar to be able to watch any game you want and then they also have a massive projection screen for some of the bigger games as well and to watch from upstairs.They also have some of the most friendly staff I have ever met in my entire life. THEY ARE GREAT! Great doesn't even describe it. They're jubilant! Yeah, that's right your learning new words!

Anyways, Moving on to the upstairs, They have a pool table A SECOND smaller bar and another set of TV's! They also have darts and lots more seating up their. On most nights the upstairs is nice and quiet and not crowed at all so you can usually sneak in a couple games of pool and darts. Oh and this place is usually pretty clean but its a dive bar so spills can happen. Finally the outdoor patio wraps around the back of the bar just a tad and has some nice tables to sit at as well. Jeez, with all the seating you could sit a small town in there and it doesn't seem like that big of a building. Like I said it has some great staff, a nice building, and lots of seating. And great patty melts.. mmmm ok thats it i'm going to get one when i'm done with this review. Get on down there to watch some good sports, and eat and drink well without busting the bank.

Now, I've eaten in my fair share of upscale Manhattan restaurants.  As a Vegetarian I am pretty particular about my food choices and have no problem dropping serious coin for fresh, delicious food.  I was shopping in the area and decided to drop in and have a relaxing lunch.  I was impressed by the space and the vibe of the place so looked forward to a memorable meal.  Upon entering the space I was asked if I was waiting for someone to join me.  I said I would be dining alone.  I was shown a lovely table in the middle of the room and given a menu. I proceeded to wait and .............wait.  I watched as others  who were seated after me had their orders taken and were served.  I was completely ignored by every single member of the wait staff.   After 25 minutes I got up and asked a server who my server was as I would be writing a review and wanted to mention him or her by name.  At that point I was asked if I was waiting for someone. I left to go spend my money elsewhere.  I will not be returning any time soon.	0	0	0	['town', 'connecticut', 'current', 'address', 'ive', 'eaten', 'fair', 'share', 'upscal', 'manhattan', 'restaur', 'vegetarian', 'pretti', 'particular', 'food', 'choic', 'problem', 'drop', 'seriou', 'coin', 'fresh', 'delici', 'food', 'shop', 'area', 'decid', 'drop', 'relax', 'lunch', 'impress', 'space', 'vibe', 'place', 'look', 'forward', 'memor', 'meal', 'upon', 'enter', 'space', 'ask', 'wait', 'someon', 'join', 'said', 'would', 'dine', 'alon', 'shown', 'love', 'tabl', 'middl', 'room', 'given', 'menu', 'proceed', 'wait', 'wait', 'watch', 'other', 'seat', 'order', 'taken', 'serv', 'complet', 'ignor', 'everi', 'singl', 'member', 'wait', 'staff', 'minut', 'got', 'ask', 'server', 'server', 'would', 'write', 'review', 'want', 'mention', 'name', 'point', 'ask', 'wait', 'someon', 'left', 'go', 'spend', 'money', 'elsewher', 'return', 'time', 'soon']

Krystyna was our dance teacher and she was amazing. We were pretty indecisive about our ""first dance"" song so she suggested that we learn swing. Particularly since the dance moves are easily applicable to a variety of songs. Then we shortlisted our top contenders for ""first dance"" song and she spent a considerable amount of effort listing the pros and cons of each song choice and ultimately helping us pick the perfect song. Ultimately Krystyna choreographed an entire dance routine taking into account our preferences. She was even considerate enough to integrate some middle eastern flavors to our dance.

We are really excited to show off our new moves (especially since we're total novices) in a couple of weeks. We'll definitely be returning for group classes in the future. It's a great and friendly place.

The experience overall was very positive . The office is nice and clean , the staff are caring and concerned , they will answer all of your questions without judging you but making you feel comfortable and respected . The ultra sound technician was very friendly and will not show you the ultra sound unless you request it . The nurses are very nice and friendly , they made me feel at ease because I was super nervous and scared. They explained the procedure to me and answered all of my questions . 
Dr.Levy is wonderful , gentle , caring with a lot of experience . He came in and introduced himself ... Explained a few things about the procedure and asked me if I had any concerns or question . He had a female doctor working with him (I was so nervous I forgot her name ) . However she came in with Dr. Levy and explained the procedure as well and made me feel at ease. She held my hand and assured me I am in good hands . I started to cry and Dr.Levy handed me a tissue and held my hand making me feel comfortable and telling me it will be ok ... Fast and pain free . Both the doctors and the nurses have great bed side manner . They all spoke to me about different topics during the procedure to keep my mind off . It was literally 4mins later that they were finished . I did not feel a thing . The IV makes you feel like your in la la land . The nurse that took care of me after was so friendly and caring .

A friend was in town for work, so we met for dinner.  I can't even recall the last time I was in the Venetian's Grand Canal Shops.  As a local whenever I am in the malls or shopping areas in this town, it's a nuisance being bombarded by the sales people of the kiosks and such. I'm typically on guard and before they can finish one word, my Long Island accent spews out ha ha ha!
However, the young man standing right outside of Brilliance was a pleasant surprise! He's a doll! Handed me a hair serum sample and we chatted. Knowledgable about the products they have. The store is clean and a sizable selection!  I will return, just because of the young man. He had gorgeous, glowing skin! Hopefully when I return he is there! Sadly, I did not catch his name.

The entire row behind us- yes, empty. Yet, we had two people seated right next to us.  
Indeed we inquired about spreading out a bit- absolutely not we were told.  What prompted our question was the man directly to our right spoke the entire show. Nope, not in a whisper regular speaking tone.  Heard his every word Perfectly clear over the music.  I gave him a stare down a few times and yes!  I made mention about him speaking. He clearly had the me, me, me syndrome. As did his wife, her shoes were off (no socks) and she had them hanging over the seats in front of her.  I heard more of him than the show!

She was constantly multitasking as she assisted me with an online return (which stemmed from online Sephora and was horrendous) that's for another time and place:)
How is Nikki not a Sephora Ambassador around this globe!  
Nikki maintained a friendly disposition, and positive environment on a hectic Shopping Sunday.  The store was pristine and organized, lovely ladies constantly offering assistance and cleaning.  I spent an hour and a half with Nikki, and visually watched her maneuver the phone, registers, customers, products and anything else which came her way.  Nikki had me calm, cool and collected.  If you know me, I'm a NYer.  High-strung and everything nice;)  Prior Nikki, I had a useless phone conversation with Sephora online.  I knew whomever had this online return in store would be frazzled, Nikki was not:)
Please go into this Sephora for all your shopping needs, and if they don't have the items they will gladly order them for you- free shipping as well;(

I'm not a Mexican Food fan, but I just tell you these are delicious and for that price I wonder why can't other places make them as great these!  If more places made nachos this tasty, I could be turned ha!  I do favor those chips, and other times the pretzel bites.  The shrimp pesto I've had twice and it can be addicting.

This was my third and final time at Other Mama.
Third time was far from a charm.
Other Mama conveys a sense of 'busy-ness', it indeed is a room with a low ceiling and dark walls. I arrived before the others in my party. Yes, indeed I had a reservation.
As I glimpsed around I noticed five available tables, as well as available bar space. 
I was 'greeted' by an unprofessional female, whom requires experience in communication.  I informed her I made a previous reservation (she never inquired about the name or how many). A few happenings and horrendous communication transpired for fifteen minutes regarding if I may sit at the bar.  Will spare her and the person she questioned he embarrassment of that.  This said person should have addressed me bubble- he did not. 
She then returns for a third time... 
Blurts out: we are slammed. Then motions towards the seat by the door\/slash 'hostess area'.  Tells me 'sit there' and she will bring me a drink. I glimpse around the room, which is the size of a basement.  I still see five empty tables (in addition with the empty seating at the bar).  I provided her with an unpleasant tone along with a sarcastic and curt reply: apparently so (in response for her ''we are slammed').  Thinking, one would catch on and have a manager come speak with me- no.  Now, she motions at one of those empty tables and tells me you sit there then.  I was more than put off at this point.  My fault for not leaving. 
The other two in my party arrive. Yet another server appears. We order drinks, five appetizers, then a bottle of wine (there are three of us). We notice the halibut on the board.  All decide we would like that as our entrees and ordered. Yes, we were still hungry as plates are small portions.  
A decent amount of time has transpired after ordering the halibut (should've had the halibut at this point). Our party watches other diners who were seated well after us received their food and finish entire meals.  
I notice a man approach the board and erase the halibut. Light bulb goes off now- run out of that halibut did you...
Forty five minutes have gone by since ordering the halibut.  I will refrain from my initial thought of what these three halibut dishes appeared in resembling.  I will accompany a picture of one of the three halibuts.  Make note that the halibut dish posted was the 'most appealing' one of the three.  None were appealing.

The menu provides various accompaniments which would delight any palate.  Their desserts always tantalize my sweet tooth, and I have many ;).  This means leave room for dessert, please:).

Magic Mike & Pink Taco under the same roof- THINK ABOUT IT ;)  This combination alone can only equal an epic night: perhaps of all sorts of debauchery, tsunami of sexyness!  
I have a great appreciation and thank you for Yelp, Taylor & the wonderful Elizabeth (I was her plus one) for this event.  I've had numerous friends from back home, yes indeed male & female inquiring about the Magic Mike show.  I can now report back that it's time they book those flights and we see this Magic Mike troupe;). Yes, a friend has planned to come into town and I will be seeing MM round 2.  
The cherry on top of the show was inevitably the MC.  Listen, she can ride a unicorn, along with charming the crowd with antedotes we all know so well:)

Sadly the parking on a Tuesday afternoon was rather challenging. It took me twenty minutes at the machine. Three cars ahead of me. I should've known, piling on took ten minutes. Luckily the attendant was on hand and she was helpful. Bonus, she remembered assisting me when I came in. The bar wouldn't go up and she even had issues with it releasing up so I could proceed into the garage. Yes, my plate was correctly on the parking meter ticket. Leaving it told me invalid ticket. That was after waiting twenty minutes on the line so I could leave. 
Now, onto lunch (once I finally left the parking garage situation).
Met some friends yesterday afternoon who were staying at Aria. It was about 12:30 on a Tuesday- not at all busy. Our waitress was far from that. My friend's husband inquired about the soup, and she spoke AT him and then as if he had no idea about soup or food. If personalities were sold, I would purchase one for her. She never returned inquiring if we needed anything additional. When she brought our drinks she basically threw them down. We thought about dessert, espresso what have you. Then we thought about our waitress. Thought it was better in just leaving sooner than later. The pizza wasn't fully cooked, underneath was more on the raw dough end and no brown on the bottom.

Last night (Wednesday evening), a friend and myself were in the mood for a Stephen King movie.  Being we are not afraid of clowns we were excited about Mr. Kings movie- IT.  This place of business was, for lack of a better word a MESS.  I immediately questioned, when was the last time the inside of this place was cleaned.  Rubbish was all over, I mean not just the floor, but the counter tops at the concession purchasing area was filthy. As was the area where one grabs their condiments, napkins, what have you.  Then (as I always do in good habit) I take a restroom pit stop prior the movie. 95% of the sinks something was not working, whether it was the hot or cold, the drain, the soap. WAIT, not one drop of soap dripped.  Now, with that being stated I would not be consuming anything I purchased from the concession area. I will spare you the details of those stalls with the commodes.  I exited the 'restroom'
Now, enter the actual theater for IT.  Filthy.
This goes beyond cleaning between showings.  I'm assuming the last time this place was cleaned was months ago.

Sadly, my Mother spends her money in this establishment if that's what it is.  As one can read the previous reviews of this store's 'wonderful customer service' this review will not come as a surprise. 
Abhorrent customer service from the 'person' behind the counter yesterday afternoon.  If you tell me I can call corporate, offer me the number, walk away into the back room in order to obtain it all but returning seconds later without it and then inform me you will call the owner. What changed?  Something did, and it was even more down hill from that moment.  Immediate defense mechanisms are a clear sign...
No courtesy, or respect for a person or customer for that matter. I am the customer and perhaps speaking differently COULD, just could be one outlet of channeling a compromise.  Coming off in less than six seconds and being defensive speaks volumes. As the owner was far from having a personality, and being combative immediately with me in the phone, the 'worker' in the store literally and abruptly dropped the items in the bag back at me without a word.  Think a sleazy car salesman in your mind, what one will encounter as I did yesterday.  He was apparently
trained or perhaps knows the 'drill' in calling the owner after speaking with a customer for a couple of minutes in calling the owner right off the bat.  Things that make you go hmmm (that's right scratch the head)!   Oh, I never was provided with the customer service number.  Hays fine, I'm self sufficient and have located that number. 
Common sense, I was told.  Well, 'common sense' is what one should use when dealing with a customer. 
Being defensive in a matter of a couple of minutes hmmm.  No surprise after seeing the reviews.  Clearly nothing has been learned from the previously 'outstanding' reviews of this location.  If sarcasm had a font, it would be used in this review (hence the quotes).

Seriously, go and be seated in Mindy's area and you will know why she's who she is- wonderful!  All the staff are here, but she's my favorite. Yes, as it it everyone has favorites. 
Food is always great quality ingredients, prepared quickly and arrive in front of you piping hot. I usually order the tuna melt.  Being the NYer I am, I do alter it.  Try it: tuna melt, rye toast, no lettuce, but make sure that cheese is Swiss. I en a provolone would do.  No, step it up and make the change away from cheddar\/yellow American cheese please;)
Always order a dessert, nope no favorite. WELL, I do.  Not telling, Simply try them all at once or over various visits!

Music enthusiasts can enjoy the open area and spectacular sound system.  A dose of bowling is your fancy, it's here with a phenomenal view of the venue's stage.  Brooklyn Bowl has an intimate atmosphere, creating a convenient place for seeing live shows.  I've attended a number of shows at this Brooklyn Bowl location, as well as the location on Wythe Avenue:)  One can't help become enthusiastic during music shows here:)  I simply wish I can review each individual show since every performer brings their own raw presence into shows. 
Peruse the eclectic gift shop across from the food venue here after having some scrumptious appetizers.  Gander out onto the patio and have some cocktails. You will not be disappointed."	1	0	0	['concert', 'venu', 'bowl', 'alley', 'may', 'ask', 'neitherit', 'music', 'venu', 'bowl', 'alley', 'eateri', 'concern', 'noseble', 'seat', 'fine', 'stadium', 'seat', 'music', 'enthusiast', 'enjoy', 'open', 'area', 'spectacular', 'sound', 'system', 'dose', 'bowl', 'fanci', 'phenomen', 'view', 'venu', 'stage', 'brooklyn', 'bowl', 'intim', 'atmospher', 'creat', 'conveni', 'place', 'see', 'live', 'show', 'ive', 'attend', 'number', 'show', 'brooklyn', 'bowl', 'locat', 'well', 'locat', 'wyth', 'avenu', 'one', 'cant', 'help', 'becom', 'enthusiast', 'music', 'show', 'simpli', 'wish', 'review', 'individu', 'show', 'sinc', 'everi', 'perform', 'bring', 'raw', 'presenc', 'show', 'perus', 'eclect', 'gift', 'shop', 'across', 'food', 'venu', 'scrumptiou', 'appet', 'gander', 'onto', 'patio', 'cocktail', 'disappoint']

Finally, I've been stalking Magnum since that banner has been hanging outside facing Sunset.
I could not be happier that I can now enjoy their caffeine selections. 
Carefully sourced beans and some on a seasonal rotation.  Please take a view of the video I posted of the seasonal ones at the Magnum 'flavor station' please;)

You won't find over-glorified (insert that green chain logo) style monstrosities here at Magnum.  Magnum roaster doesn't need enhancements, their flavors are brought out by the specific beans they roast on site. 
My favorite, Michigan Cherry.  Well, on second thought their Cinnamon Bun.  Listen, well in this case taste.  
Feel free to Inhale Magnum's flavor station.  I did.  Yes, purchased Michigan Cherry, Blueberry crumble, Pumpkin Pie & Cinnamon Bun.  All are quite tasty, and good to the last drop!

Ordered two lattes & two cakes.  
Third fork into the Matcha with raspberry sauce we come across hairs baked in. Informed the female, she immediately removed this Matcha from our table.  Yes, she did remove this from the bill and only that.  Clearly we didn't have our Thai cake, nor finish our lattes.  
Prior this: We walked in with no acknowledgment or hello whatsoever.  Finally as we were just going to seat ourselves, only then were we acknowledged by a motion of the arm to be seated. Menus put in front of us and she walked away. Did anyone engage us, not until I loudly asked a question.  Timmy (who was a new employee) came immediately over with a beaming smile and spoke with us. Timmy was friendly & engaging.  
Kudos for Timmy!  
The others were not friendly.  An older gentleman kept pacing by our table, nodding (no smile). This was unsettlingly.  Did you not want us there?
Only two other customers were inside.
Should've left at that point. 
However, we kept asking questions prior ordering since nobody except Timmy was engaging.  The others came across as having a sense of entitlement as they were doing us a favor. 
I expected more, no not hairs baked into our Matcha.  
Because we are a town with diverse cultures, it is up to the staff in creating a friendly and welcoming environment. Leave certain ways outside of the establishment.

There was a malfunction which one of the cashier girls fixed immediately. Then we had another malfunction and a manager by the name of Richard P. argued with us that it was not a malfunction and we did not push the button to bet correctly. He was extremely rude and obnoxious. It was really embarassing because he started yelling and getting really upset and everyone was looking. We told him to look at the logs because there were prior malfunctions because he said he did not believe us. Mind you this game is only a quarter to play and we won a dollar which was due to us and the game did not pay it out. Richard refused to pay it out which is fine since it's only a dollar. It's just really sad that a service manager would treat customer this way. This was a really cool place and had so much fun with my friends here until Richard P pretty much ruined the vibe.

The manager, some guy with an Australian accent helped me. I had a tire warranty through the dealership when I bought my car. I know discount tire honors the warranty because the last time I needed a tire replaced the discount tire at lake mead \/ boulder hwy replaced it with no issues. The warranty I have, I buy the tire out of my pocket and the warranty company reimburses me. All the warranty company asks for is for a representative of the business to take 3 minutes of their time to advise them of the tread depth and any sidewall damage. The manager refused to talk to them and said he would not do it because I got my money's worth out if the tire. No matter how I explained it to him it just wouldn't get the fact that I was going to pay for the tires and he just needed to give the info to the warranty rep so I could be reimbursed. The warranty company advised me if he was refusing to talk to them I should take my business elsewhere which I did. I went to Big O Tire on lake mead and Chuck the owner was awesome and took care of my warranty for me. He even held the bad tire until I received my reimbursement incase there were any problems.

I told them I was going to upgrade those by another $30 or so, and was so excited to pick them up the day before Valentine's Day.

When I went to pick them up today, I was shocked: They did put long-stemmed roses, which I didn't order, but they had scraggly stargazer lilies, even though I had specifically instructed them not to get stargazer lilies.  One of the rose stems was broken in half, with the flower just hanging straight down ... some of the leaves were chewed by bug or all dirty ... and a number of the leaf stems were also broken in half.  I was completely underwhelmed.  

I am usually not one to complain, but I told them I was hugely disappointed in the flowers --- one of the ladies there acted annoyed, and kept reminding me that this was definitely worth the money I spent.  I stuck to my guns, and, to their credit, they tried to spruce it up and replaced the stargazers with a few white lilies (only about half as many).  I ended up going through the arrangement once I was in my car, cleaning it up, breaking off the ruined stems, etc ... 

This may have been an anomaly, and they may normally do a fantastic job, but I will never use them again."	9	0	0	['walk', 'lena', 'three', 'week', 'valentin', 'day', 'would', 'abl', 'order', 'someth', 'fantast', 'girl', 'im', 'crazi', 'girl', 'help', 'show', 'pictur', 'beauti', 'arrang', 'rose', 'white', 'lili', 'want', 'told', 'go', 'upgrad', 'anoth', 'excit', 'pick', 'day', 'valentin', 'daywhen', 'went', 'pick', 'today', 'shock', 'put', 'longstem', 'rose', 'didnt', 'order', 'scraggli', 'stargaz', 'lili', 'even', 'though', 'specif', 'instruct', 'get', 'stargaz', 'lili', 'one', 'rose', 'stem', 'broken', 'half', 'flower', 'hang', 'straight', 'leav', 'chew', 'bug', 'dirti', 'number', 'leaf', 'stem', 'also', 'broken', 'half', 'complet', 'underwhelm', 'usual', 'one', 'complain', 'told', 'huge', 'disappoint', 'flower', 'one', 'ladi', 'act', 'annoy', 'kept', 'remind', 'definit', 'worth', 'money', 'spent', 'stuck', 'gun', 'credit', 'tri', 'spruce', 'replac', 'stargaz', 'white', 'lili', 'half', 'mani', 'end', 'go', 'arrang', 'car', 'clean', 'break', 'ruin', 'stem', 'etc', 'may', 'anomali', 'may', 'normal', 'fantast', 'job', 'never', 'use']

Their guidelines are in place to ensure a pet doesn't go to just any home, that it will be cared for and loved. Also, they are sure to socialize their adoptable animals to give that dog\/cat the best chance at being adaptable in a new home. 

The directors of this rescue are informative, helpful and obviously passionate about what they do. It shows in the way the rescue is operated and in the dedication given to homeless animals.

We've never had bad service here and until something drastic changes, we will be frequent customers at this little strip mall joint."	0	0	2	['first', 'time', 'visit', 'impress', 'restaur', 'pho', 'place', 'common', 'neck', 'wood', 'happi', 'found', 'one', 'serv', 'great', 'food', 'provid', 'good', 'servicewhil', 'pho', 'usual', 'beef', 'broth', 'owner', 'happi', 'make', 'veggieveget', 'broth', 'noodl', 'herb', 'veget', 'delici', 'soup', 'bodi', 'soul', 'good', 'definit', 'comfort', 'food', 'veggi', 'spring', 'roll', 'also', 'good', 'weve', 'never', 'bad', 'servic', 'someth', 'drastic', 'chang', 'frequent', 'custom', 'littl', 'strip', 'mall', 'joint']

Rent was very reasonable for such a nice area (hop, skip and a jump from Ocotillo.) Our apartment itself was lovely with upgraded appliances and a great kitchen. The two bedroom we were in was spacious, had great natural lighting and was overall very nice. I wasn't a huge fan of their parking policy. We had one covered space and the other was a first come first serve. We didn't take advantage of the amenities as often as we should have but when we did they were a reminder of the spoils of apartment living.

The building itself is older and does not have an elevator--meaning that anyone who has a physical disability which renders them unable to climb stairs, must buy tickets on the orchestra level. Out of the many shows I have attended here, there have been frequent issues with the sound system...disappointing when you are sitting further than 5 rows from the stage.

That is a unique quality in a photographer and has made for some great experiences!

We originally synced up with him to start documenting our little one's growth. From 3 months old and onward, he's given our family the precious gift of immortalized memories. With reasonable pricing, a quick turnaround, and stellar customer service, hiring Buck to photograph your family\/event is a no-brainer.

Kerri acted as a planner for our event. While our venue came with a wedding planner, she was extremely helpful when it came to details, contacting vendors, etc...she also provided our linens for us at a very reasonable rate. They were beautiful and she really had an eye for what worked, what didn't work and most importantly, what made her clients happy.

This is good, hearty food that hits the spot. My go-to meal can be any variation of the eggplant parm pasty, the cream of leek, potato, and stilton soup, or the Greek pasty.

We arrived right at 9am when they opened which I was pleased with. Not only was it still hot that day but by the time we left around 10:30, it was very busy. Pumpkins are picked out a short hayride\/train ride from the main premises. If you have really little ones, it's probably not the most convenient but it was fine for toddlers.

We'll go back next year!"	1	0	1	['cute', 'visit', 'ranch', 'weekend', 'halloween', 'brought', 'mo', 'old', 'pick', 'pumpkin', 'see', 'sight', 'went', 'crazi', 'pet', 'zoo', 'might', 'adopt', 'pig', 'one', 'day', 'like', 'hay', 'maze', 'toow', 'arriv', 'right', 'open', 'pleas', 'still', 'hot', 'day', 'time', 'left', 'around', 'busi', 'pumpkin', 'pick', 'short', 'hayridetrain', 'ride', 'main', 'premis', 'realli', 'littl', 'one', 'probabl', 'conveni', 'fine', 'toddlerswel', 'go', 'back', 'next', 'year']

You could easily spend the majority of a day walking around aimlessly and taking in the scenery. Even when I'm not in the market for any big ticket items, I enjoy seeing the rooms they have set up to showcase their products. It never fails that I'm walking out of there with a least one or two gadgets. The overall concept of the store is great. While it may not be the highest quality of furniture, it does its job well and certainly can be used in most decorating styles. Some items are moderately priced. Others (ie; lounge chairs) seem overpriced to me. But that's the beauty of IKEA--you can pick and choose. I don't think there is another store on this planet that i say, ""Wouldn't this look great?"" more than I do in IKEA.

This experience was overall much better than our tickets for Pablo Francisco over the summer. We chose the earlier show this time  which started right on time and didn't have nearly as many openers. 

My husband and I both opted for the 'bottomless' fountain drink to cover our two drink minimum. Our server was nowhere to be found after our initial drink service and she reappeared 15 minutes before the end of the show with our first refill and the check. She was all over the place, never said thanks for coming in (or anything of the sort) and refused to smile. It's a comedy club! It is definitely tight quarters without much wiggle room. I am sure we'll be back because they really do have the best headliners in the Valley. However, I would expect better service as this is not a cheap night out. After tickets, the drink minimum and gratuity included in the tab (for just two people?) we easily dropped $100.

I knew when we were married in April 2009 that I wanted a Maggie Soterro gown so choosing this boutique was a no brainer. In all fairness, my dress was perfect. Suzanne herself did the alterations and it was perfection. Unfortunately, our patronage did not stop with my gown and thus the slippery slope began.

My mother also purchased her dress from Suzanne's and while it was nice, it was discovered on the day of the wedding that an entire seam had be left open during alterations. Strike one. My groom, his groomsmen, ushers, and fathers all rented their tuxedos from here as well. I am not exaggerating when I say there was something wrong with every single (count it, 7!) tuxedo. Holes in the shirts, lipstick on the collars, ivory and white shirts mixed together, wrong sizes, the list goes on and on. The best part of it all was my husband's shoe breaking during pre-ceremony pictures. He switched shoes with his best man so as to stay on solid ground during our wedding :) Coming in a close second was my father-in-law being peed on by one of the owner's dogs (in a bridal shop?!) when he went to go pick up his tux. A BIG strike two.

The icing on the cake was while my husband and I were on our honeymoon. Suzanne called my mother to tell her all of the tuxedos had not been returned (untrue.) While my mom calmly explained everything that had gone wrong, Suzanne yelled at her and accused my husband of doing something to break the shoe, that I was ungrateful, etc...I really didn't consider myself to be a bridezilla, found the comments to be totally unfounded and offensive toward myself, my husband and my mom. Oh, and the phone call was ended in a lovely professional way-she hung up on my mom after laying into her. Strike three, you're out.

I know weddings don't go perfectly. After it was said and done the issues with the tuxedos were a joke in a our family. However, the treatment we received from Suzanne (the owner) was unprofessional, rude and childish. I can't recommend this shop to anyone. Spend a little more money and go somewhere that has more to offer than just selection."	19	3	0	['suzann', 'great', 'select', 'dress', 'knew', 'marri', 'april', 'want', 'maggi', 'soterro', 'gown', 'choos', 'boutiqu', 'brainer', 'fair', 'dress', 'perfect', 'suzann', 'alter', 'perfect', 'unfortun', 'patronag', 'stop', 'gown', 'thu', 'slipperi', 'slope', 'beganmi', 'mother', 'also', 'purchas', 'dress', 'suzann', 'nice', 'discov', 'day', 'wed', 'entir', 'seam', 'left', 'open', 'alter', 'strike', 'one', 'groom', 'groomsmen', 'usher', 'father', 'rent', 'tuxedo', 'well', 'exagger', 'say', 'someth', 'wrong', 'everi', 'singl', 'count', 'tuxedo', 'hole', 'shirt', 'lipstick', 'collar', 'ivori', 'white', 'shirt', 'mix', 'togeth', 'wrong', 'size', 'list', 'goe', 'best', 'part', 'husband', 'shoe', 'break', 'preceremoni', 'pictur', 'switch', 'shoe', 'best', 'man', 'stay', 'solid', 'ground', 'wed', 'come', 'close', 'second', 'fatherinlaw', 'peed', 'one', 'owner', 'dog', 'bridal', 'shop', 'went', 'go', 'pick', 'tux', 'big', 'strike', 'twoth', 'ice', 'cake', 'husband', 'honeymoon', 'suzann', 'call', 'mother', 'tell', 'tuxedo', 'return', 'untru', 'mom', 'calmli', 'explain', 'everyth', 'gone', 'wrong', 'suzann', 'yell', 'accus', 'husband', 'someth', 'break', 'shoe', 'ungrat', 'etci', 'realli', 'didnt', 'consid', 'bridezilla', 'found', 'comment', 'total', 'unfound', 'offens', 'toward', 'husband', 'mom', 'oh', 'phone', 'call', 'end', 'love', 'profession', 'waysh', 'hung', 'mom', 'lay', 'strike', 'three', 'your', 'outi', 'know', 'wed', 'dont', 'go', 'perfectli', 'said', 'done', 'issu', 'tuxedo', 'joke', 'famili', 'howev', 'treatment', 'receiv', 'suzann', 'owner', 'unprofession', 'rude', 'childish', 'cant', 'recommend', 'shop', 'anyon', 'spend', 'littl', 'money', 'go', 'somewher', 'offer', 'select']

I appreciated her getting back to me so quickly and her willingness to fit me into their schedule. That was about the extent of any positive experience I had with them.

I was given an arrival time of 2-3 pm. At 3, the owner contacted me saying the girls were running about half an hour late...no big deal. At 4:15, no one had come yet. I was then called by the crew saying they had run out of gas and would have to reschedule. I said that would not be possible because the reason I needed the cleaning done that day was because we were moving in the following day. They said they would try to get on the road and figure something out. At 6 pm they finally arrived. The girls were very sweet but on top of everything that had happened, I was expecting a thorough cleaning. They did a great job on the bathrooms but I felt everything else was either brushed over or not noticed at all. One reason we needed cleaning was because the previous tenants had a dog with very long hair. At the end of our cleaning, there was still hair and dirt on the ""mopped"" kitchen floor, the inside of the fridge, freezer and cabinets had not been touched. I don't know if my experience was a fluke but it added a lot of anxiety to an already stressful week. My husband and I have spent the last three days cleaning what should have already been a clean townhouse. I still ended up paying what I would have if the correct appointment time had been kept and at the end of all of it, I received an e-mail saying if I did a Yelp review I would receive $20 off my next appointment.

We had never been there before and while we have visited similar theaters in other cities, we didn't quite know what to expect from iPic. From start to finish, this was a wonderful experience. So wonderful that I think I am ruined for regular movie theaters. 

We bought the upgraded seats which are comfy recliners that come with a blanket, pillow and your very own popcorn. The wait staff was very helpful and although we didn't order food, our drinks came out very quickly. It is a bit costly...at $25 for one of these seats it is not something we will be doing every weekend.

On a recent Saturday night, we were craving a delicious cheese crisp and pitcher of sangria. After we had learned our lesson on weekends past, my husband called ahead for seating and we were informed it would be 45 minutes. No big deal and nothing we didn't expect. 

An hour after our call in time, and waiting in the restaurant for 30 minutes, I approached the hostess asking where we were on the list. She informed me it would be just a bit longer and they were working to get us a table. Half an hour after that, no table. I politely approached again and it was clear that we had been skipped, marked off the list and forgotten. The hostess stated the next table would be ours and to give them just a few more minutes. When I went to sit back down, the couple sitting next to us were seated. Infuriated, we both decided it was time to leave. My husband gave our pager back and the hostesses stood there like deer in the headlights. They said sorry but made no attempt to make the situation right. 

I find this type of thing to be completely unacceptable. We were patient, understood there would be a wait and still chose to spend our date night at this restaurant. In return we were greeted with lousy customer service and no table. On the plus side, we discovered a new restaurant right across the way we have been to multiple times now.

I'm not sure when\/why the switch happened but the front desk has morphed from customer service to high-pressure sales.

When we arrived, we were seated promptly but it took 20 minutes to have waters brought to the table. It took another 30 minutes for our food to be served.

First of all, any pub that has Hoegaarden on draft is automatically a winner in my book. When you add that plus a great happy hour, life is good. If you just want to get your drink on after a long day at the office, Cornish is hard to beat. If you want to drink AND eat (two of the best things a person can do) you will have an evening to remember. I'm vegetarian and this place has a ton of options for me.

When a parent decides on a school whose staff spends more waking hours with your child than you do, things get realllll. In my daycare search, I found our decision making process to be based on logistics but more so, on a mama bear's instinct. 

When I reached out to April, the school director, and asked for a tour, I wasn't really sure what to expect. Guys and gals, I'm here to tell you that if you have a little one, your child will be so loved and so well cared for at MVCP. 

Our LO attended the 1's class (12-24 months) for 7 months and we only left because of an out-of-state relocation. Marie was the lead teacher, aided by the amazingly wonderful Lauren, Carly, and Leslie. I can't say enough wonderful things about this band of gals. Our babe cemented a great relationship with them early in her tenure there. She's pretty choosy about who she lets in to that toddler heart. Marie and gang felt like an extension of family and for that, I am so grateful for our time at MVCP.

Our wait on a Friday night was only about 15 minutes and during the short interim, we hit up the bar for some drinks. After being seated, our very friendly server explained the specials and took our orders. Between the four of us, we ordered olives, Caesar salads, funghi, BBQ chicken and Yukon gold pizzas. Holy schmoly were they good. It is difficult to find crust like that and you can tell they have the right type of oven to make an amazing pie. The large pizza is plenty big for two people and the pizza my husband and I split (the funghi) was ahhhhhmazing. The flavors were bold, rich and oh so satisfying.

It took a good 15 minutes to get our check and another 15 to get our cards back after paying. Of course I was in a rush but even if I wasn't, that's a long time to wait to pay your server.

As other Yelpers have stated, for such a large airport the security check goes relatively quickly. Terminal 4 is the biggest\/best with restaurants, shops, etc but the other terminals are fine as well. Make sure if you're getting dropped off\/parking a car that you're at the correct terminal. They're working on a tram but for now you either have a hefty walk or have to catch a shuttle to get to another terminal. Plan ahead, know where you're going and you'll be just fine. Free wi-fi for your layover pleasure and an overall well kept building makes Sky Harbor a great departure point from Phoenix...c'mon, you wouldn't want to be here when it's 115 degrees either.	2	0	3	['think', 'far', 'airport', 'go', 'sky', 'harbor', 'pretti', 'great', 'yelper', 'state', 'larg', 'airport', 'secur', 'check', 'goe', 'rel', 'quickli', 'termin', 'biggestbest', 'restaur', 'shop', 'etc', 'termin', 'fine', 'well', 'make', 'sure', 'your', 'get', 'drop', 'offpark', 'car', 'your', 'correct', 'termin', 'theyr', 'work', 'tram', 'either', 'hefti', 'walk', 'catch', 'shuttl', 'get', 'anoth', 'termin', 'plan', 'ahead', 'know', 'your', 'go', 'youll', 'fine', 'free', 'wifi', 'layov', 'pleasur', 'overal', 'well', 'kept', 'build', 'make', 'sky', 'harbor', 'great', 'departur', 'point', 'phoenixcmon', 'wouldnt', 'want', 'degre', 'either']

I grew up on New Mexican fare and it is not an easy cuisine to perfect. I was also a little reluctant toward the menu as their vegetarian options seemed few and far between. 

We visited the restaurant with another couple who are avid carnivores. We were pleasantly surprised to find something on the menu for everyone. My husband and I split the chili rellenos and cheese enchiladas. The beans are vegetarian but the rice is not so in lieu of it, we were able to get a green chili potato (ridiculously tasty). The food was delightfully packed with heat -- the kind of heat that's cured by a bowl of ice cream or more of what caused the burn in the first place. It IS spicy so be sure to heed the warning on their menu. I dabbed my forehead with a napkin more than once. 

To me, there's something about a server who knows her stuff. Our server was fantastic. We wanted for nothing during our entire experience and she knew exactly what was safe for us to eat as vegetarians. 

I don't agree with others who think this place is overpriced. Our party of four had the same number of entrees, a bottle of wine, and two cocktails for $120. And yes, they only have valet parking.

Our food was wonderful. We split an order of french toast and the garlic mushroom scramble. Both were delicious but I could go on and on about the scramble...the sauce on it was savory, rich and the perfect topping for eggs. My orange juice was not that great this time--it was pretty sour but that could be a fluke because the last time we were here my OJ was superb and definitely worth the money.

I was so impressed with his punctuality, professionalism and friendly personality.

Esplanade is fantastic and while it's a bit of a drive for us, it is a a theater  I will gladly put miles on my car for. Between the two types of theaters, I would recommend the Cinema Suites. These theaters are smaller (less people to annoy you,) no kids allowed,  the cushy seats recline, no one can kick your chair (you're in your own partitioned row,) and best of all you have your very own server in your very own reserved seat.

It's in a great part of Phoenix, the Biltmore area has plenty of options should you choose to have dinner outside of the the theater. Make sure if you park in the garage you have the front desk validate your ticket. Also, reserve tickets online before you head out the door. The theaters are small and sell out very quickly.

I knew I would be going back to work and wanted to have arrangements made well in advance. Who would've thought quality daycare comes with applications and long waitlists?

5 months before I was due, I started researching and scheduling tours. I had heard nothing but stellar things about Montessori. That combined with Villa's infant room, almost unheard of at these schools, was an immediate draw for me.

I don't want to bore you with the details but after several postponements of our tour, unresponsiveness from staff members, and clear internal miscommunications, we never even got to see the facility. I had to go out of my way to try and establish a relationship. After several attempts, I wrote an email advising we would not be pursuing childcare at their facility. The director went above and beyond to contact me and asked if we could set up a phone call. I agreed but did not receive a call at the scheduled time -- icing on the cake.

We decided to catch an early dinner (after skipping breakfast and lunch) on Saturday. I made easy reservations on Open Table for 5pm. When we pulled up, both of us were pretty surprised by the exterior. The restaurant was in a newer looking strip mall, next to a nail salon. Not the swanky digs that I was expecting. We walked inside to an empty restaurant, as they had just opened. The host, who turned out to be our waiter, asked us if we had reservations. Yes, we did. We were seated at a small two top by the wall. I guess they couldn't spare a more roomy table. The interior of the restaurant felt like they wanted to make it look and feel upscale on a budget. 

So, Hot Stone Grill's schtick is kind of like a fondue restaurants. Switch out the hot pot for a 600 degree volcanic stone. Given this description, you would figure that the food would come out raw and you would get to cook it. Well, that wasn't quite true. The filet came seared on both sides, sitting on the stone. The shrimp and scallops came cooked but sitting on the stone cooking further. I was hoping to get the ahi tuna but they didn't have any. The fish selection was salmon and mahi mahi. But after reading the negative review about the quality of the fish, I decided on shrimp and scallops instead. In hindsight, I wish I had just ordered a filet. 

The quality of the filet was excellent, and it was kitschy fun to be able to sear the meat on the stone before eating it. We like our meat rare so we pushed the meat off the stone and threw it back on just before eating. I'm not sure what the big hoopla is over their demi glace. It was pretty bland. I preferred the peppercorn sauce, which had much more flavor. The sauces that came out with the seafood were both ok. The seafood was very bland, only having been seasoned by salt. The sides were soooo boring. The mashed potatoes seemed like those out of a box. The veggies of the day were overcooked, underseasoned, sauteed yellow bell pepper strips, onions, and zucchini. Very disappointing for a place that charges $30 per plate. I was also surprised that they didn't offer a bread basket or something. I feel like that is really par for the course. 
 
Our waiter was ok, just really awkward. He was trying way too hard. I mean who tells a customer to come up to look at the beer selection... shouldn't you have a list or something. He hovered and tried to make awkward conversation.

Overall, we won't be returning. While the filet was very good, there are much better places to visit for the price."	3	0	0	['star', 'somewher', 'meh', 'ok', 'qualiti', 'filet', 'thing', 'get', 'review', 'round', 'three', 'star', 'read', 'detailsw', 'decid', 'catch', 'earli', 'dinner', 'skip', 'breakfast', 'lunch', 'saturday', 'made', 'easi', 'reserv', 'open', 'tabl', 'pm', 'pull', 'us', 'pretti', 'surpris', 'exterior', 'restaur', 'newer', 'look', 'strip', 'mall', 'next', 'nail', 'salon', 'swanki', 'dig', 'expect', 'walk', 'insid', 'empti', 'restaur', 'open', 'host', 'turn', 'waiter', 'ask', 'us', 'reserv', 'ye', 'seat', 'small', 'two', 'top', 'wall', 'guess', 'couldnt', 'spare', 'roomi', 'tabl', 'interior', 'restaur', 'felt', 'like', 'want', 'make', 'look', 'feel', 'upscal', 'budget', 'hot', 'stone', 'grill', 'schtick', 'kind', 'like', 'fondu', 'restaur', 'switch', 'hot', 'pot', 'degre', 'volcan', 'stone', 'given', 'descript', 'would', 'figur', 'food', 'would', 'come', 'raw', 'would', 'get', 'cook', 'well', 'wasnt', 'quit', 'true', 'filet', 'came', 'sear', 'side', 'sit', 'stone', 'shrimp', 'scallop', 'came', 'cook', 'sit', 'stone', 'cook', 'hope', 'get', 'ahi', 'tuna', 'didnt', 'fish', 'select', 'salmon', 'mahi', 'mahi', 'read', 'neg', 'review', 'qualiti', 'fish', 'decid', 'shrimp', 'scallop', 'instead', 'hindsight', 'wish', 'order', 'filet', 'qualiti', 'filet', 'excel', 'kitschi', 'fun', 'abl', 'sear', 'meat', 'stone', 'eat', 'like', 'meat', 'rare', 'push', 'meat', 'stone', 'threw', 'back', 'eat', 'im', 'sure', 'big', 'hoopla', 'demi', 'glace', 'pretti', 'bland', 'prefer', 'peppercorn', 'sauc', 'much', 'flavor', 'sauc', 'came', 'seafood', 'ok', 'seafood', 'bland', 'season', 'salt', 'side', 'soooo', 'bore', 'mash', 'potato', 'seem', 'like', 'box', 'veggi', 'day', 'overcook', 'underseason', 'saute', 'yellow', 'bell', 'pepper', 'strip', 'onion', 'zucchini', 'disappoint', 'place', 'charg', 'per', 'plate', 'also', 'surpris', 'didnt', 'offer', 'bread', 'basket', 'someth', 'feel', 'like', 'realli', 'par', 'cours', 'waiter', 'ok', 'realli', 'awkward', 'tri', 'way', 'hard', 'mean', 'tell', 'custom', 'come', 'look', 'beer', 'select', 'shouldnt', 'list', 'someth', 'hover', 'tri', 'make', 'awkward', 'conversationoveral', 'wont', 'return', 'filet', 'good', 'much', 'better', 'place', 'visit', 'price']

The tap handles also wrap around the wall. I was amazed at how many taps they had! The back area is very comfy and a bit quieter. They also have a great, little patio to enjoy when the weather is nice. The servers were all pretty friendly. 

My only complaints, it was pricey and parking was challenging.

You can find their daily draught selection online. You can see if they have a favorite on tap before you go. Trivia night is on Wednesdays.

This place is amazing. Deep Sea is a seafood market that sells the freshest seafood around, from 11-2 Monday through Saturday it turns into a lunch spot. It is quite unassuming from the outside. You walk into a simple, clean space. The menu changes daily depending on what is fresh that day. There are a few items that you will always see on the menu. My favorites so far... Any version of the tuna Sandwich, Mahi Mahi Tacos, and the Blackened Catfish Po'Boy. You have two options for sides, steak fries or cilantro slaw. I always get the cilantro slaw. Which is fresh and not mayo heavy. The cilantro adds a pleasant zing to the side. I would be really excited it they added more side choices - maybe a salad or soup option would be nice. 

They have a small seating area with 5 tables total. The tables fill up during peak lunch times. My suggestion, grab your lunch to go and find a nice bench to eat it on and enjoy the outdoors. The man at the counter seems a bit gruff and unfriendly but he is a good guy.

Stopped in for lunch at this Firehouse Subs after spending the morning getting to know Charlotte. The place was pretty busy, as it was during the peak lunch hour. I was in the mood for a salad, and since there was only one on the menu, my choice was made for me. I got to pick the protein though. I chose the tuna salad. The boyfriend got the hook & ladder combo (cute). We were both amused by the large selection of hot sauces that were available (we both LOVE spicy food & hot sauce). I was largely underwhelmed with the salad, which consisted of large leafs of lettuce, a few thick bell pepper slices and a large wedges of tomato. It was topped with three sizable scoops of tuna salad and provolone cheese slices. I just wasn't psyched on the salad at all. Yes, I know I'm at a sub shop ordering a salad, but it really isn't that hard to throw a decent salad together. The boyfriend said his sub was meh. I personally prefer Which Wich.	0	0	0	['firehous', 'didnt', 'stop', 'lunch', 'firehous', 'sub', 'spend', 'morn', 'get', 'know', 'charlott', 'place', 'pretti', 'busi', 'peak', 'lunch', 'hour', 'mood', 'salad', 'sinc', 'one', 'menu', 'choic', 'made', 'got', 'pick', 'protein', 'though', 'chose', 'tuna', 'salad', 'boyfriend', 'got', 'hook', 'ladder', 'combo', 'cute', 'amus', 'larg', 'select', 'hot', 'sauc', 'avail', 'love', 'spici', 'food', 'hot', 'sauc', 'larg', 'underwhelm', 'salad', 'consist', 'larg', 'leaf', 'lettuc', 'thick', 'bell', 'pepper', 'slice', 'larg', 'wedg', 'tomato', 'top', 'three', 'sizabl', 'scoop', 'tuna', 'salad', 'provolon', 'chees', 'slice', 'wasnt', 'psych', 'salad', 'ye', 'know', 'im', 'sub', 'shop', 'order', 'salad', 'realli', 'isnt', 'hard', 'throw', 'decent', 'salad', 'togeth', 'boyfriend', 'said', 'sub', 'meh', 'person', 'prefer', 'wich']

Chima is like every other rodizio grill - extensive salad bar, various appetizers, and servers walking around with skewered meats. The salad bar wasn't as good as other Brazilian Steakhouses I've been to. The meats that were served were pretty good. The flank steak was excellent. I didn't care for the swordfish. It was really overcooked\/dry. 

Thank goodness for restaurant week, as I would have been sorely disappointed paying the normal $50+ per person. At $30 per person ($39.50 if you want the full meat rotation), I still felt shorted but not as bad. Buffets\/AYCE places are really not my style, I never feel like I eat my money's worth. 

My biggest complaint mirrors that of Kieran M.'s it totally feels like a whirlwind. We sat down, got our drinks, went up to the salad bar, and then BAM... The meat started rolling in. Not even 20 minutes later I was done... Stick a fork in it!

What sold me was the satisfaction guarantee. It takes away the fear of getting stuck for 5 lbs of awful tasting protein powder.

Warm chips kick ass salsa... Ask for the salsa verde, or the green salsa for all you gringos :) It's a jalapeno and avocado salsa that is spicy and delicious!

Almost too simple for my taste. 

They were closed last time I tired to visit. I found out that they were remodeling. I learned they recently changed ownership. The interior is small. They had a list of fro yo flavors on a chalk board. Some of them said scoop next to the flavor. I was confused, so the guy at the counter clarified that they actually scoop the fro yo out of a container. That's a first for me. I tried the original tart and the peanut butter chocolate, which was scooped. I didn't much care for the texture of the scooped fro yo. The original tart was nice and tart so I went with that. I wasn't the largest fan of the texture. A bit too icy for my taste. Their pricing is set by size but I didn't like how they charge 50 cents per topping. A cup of fro yo can get pricey quick that way. I was intrigued by the taro mochi but disappointed after trying it. Way too gummy in texture and, except for being purple, didn't remind me of taro at all.

I'd be willing to try them again next time I'm up in Noda, but they don't make my list of favorites for fro yo. 

Note: Seating is a challenge and the sidewalk outside the shop gets really crowded when it's busy."	0	0	0	['headlin', 'simpl', 'littl', 'fro', 'yo', 'shop', 'almost', 'simpl', 'tast', 'close', 'last', 'time', 'tire', 'visit', 'found', 'remodel', 'learn', 'recent', 'chang', 'ownership', 'interior', 'small', 'list', 'fro', 'yo', 'flavor', 'chalk', 'board', 'said', 'scoop', 'next', 'flavor', 'confus', 'guy', 'counter', 'clarifi', 'actual', 'scoop', 'fro', 'yo', 'contain', 'that', 'first', 'tri', 'origin', 'tart', 'peanut', 'butter', 'chocol', 'scoop', 'didnt', 'much', 'care', 'textur', 'scoop', 'fro', 'yo', 'origin', 'tart', 'nice', 'tart', 'went', 'wasnt', 'largest', 'fan', 'textur', 'bit', 'ici', 'tast', 'price', 'set', 'size', 'didnt', 'like', 'charg', 'cent', 'per', 'top', 'cup', 'fro', 'yo', 'get', 'pricey', 'quick', 'way', 'intrigu', 'taro', 'mochi', 'disappoint', 'tri', 'way', 'gummi', 'textur', 'except', 'purpl', 'didnt', 'remind', 'taro', 'allid', 'will', 'tri', 'next', 'time', 'im', 'noda', 'dont', 'make', 'list', 'favorit', 'fro', 'yo', 'note', 'seat', 'challeng', 'sidewalk', 'outsid', 'shop', 'get', 'realli', 'crowd', 'busi']

For the seasoned yogi: Check the class calendar online at y1now.com and pick a class. Get there a little early to secure your favorite spot. The sense of community at y1 rocks. Everyone I've met has been really great. My favorite class is the heated Baptiste Power Vinyasa Yoga. I always leave drenched. My favorite instructor was Daniel McAll. He rocks. 

For the newb:
Don't worry! I'll admit I was a Yoga newbie when I first stepped through the doors of Yoga One. I came at the recommendation of a girlfriend who practiced here. I'm so glad that I gave it a shot! You really don't need anything to give it a try. Just wear comfy athletic clothes and bring a bottle of water! They have mat and towels to rent. 

When I first walked in I saw the smiling faces of the staff ready to help. I told one of the ladies that I was new and I wanted to take a class. She explained the rates and had me fill out some short paperwork to get me in their system. They offer walk-in rates, which are $15 per class. Or for new students, they offer an intro deal for 31 days of practice for $31. They also offer a ton of $5 classes too! Great option for those that don't want to commit to one month.

The space is beautiful. It is a bit on the small side but they fit a lot into it without making it feel too cramped. They have a retail space that sells everything you could want, from mats and towels to clothes. They sell snacks and drinks too. 

The main (heated) room is large and easily accommodates many yogis. I appreciate the tape on the floor to show you where to park your mat. It keeps everyone lined up nicely. Grab a spot and stretch out. They have blocks and straps for everyone to use. The classes usually have at least one assistant that walks around adjusting your form. You can really feel a difference when the tweak your body. Don't worry about being sweaty! Everyone is and no one cares. 

These classes will have you sweating. I've practiced with many different instructors and I definitely had my favorites. I would seek out there classes specifically which is easy to do on their website. Consider taking the 11 week foundations course. It'll really help with your practice. 

The studio is tucked in the back of parking lot. Look for Bistro La Bon and Family Dollar. Parking is never a problem. Some classes are more crowded than others but I always felt like i had enough space. The bathrooms are small but there are changing rooms in the hall and in the front. Use those to change and leave the stalls open for the well hydrated yogis!"	6	1	2	['yoga', 'one', 'rock', 'doesnt', 'matter', 'total', 'newb', 'season', 'yogi', 'place', 'practic', 'season', 'yogi', 'check', 'class', 'calendar', 'onlin', 'ynowcom', 'pick', 'class', 'get', 'littl', 'earli', 'secur', 'favorit', 'spot', 'sens', 'commun', 'rock', 'everyon', 'ive', 'met', 'realli', 'great', 'favorit', 'class', 'heat', 'baptist', 'power', 'vinyasa', 'yoga', 'alway', 'leav', 'drench', 'favorit', 'instructor', 'daniel', 'mcall', 'rock', 'newbdont', 'worri', 'ill', 'admit', 'yoga', 'newbi', 'first', 'step', 'door', 'yoga', 'one', 'came', 'recommend', 'girlfriend', 'practic', 'im', 'glad', 'gave', 'shot', 'realli', 'dont', 'need', 'anyth', 'give', 'tri', 'wear', 'comfi', 'athlet', 'cloth', 'bring', 'bottl', 'water', 'mat', 'towel', 'rent', 'first', 'walk', 'saw', 'smile', 'face', 'staff', 'readi', 'help', 'told', 'one', 'ladi', 'new', 'want', 'take', 'class', 'explain', 'rate', 'fill', 'short', 'paperwork', 'get', 'system', 'offer', 'walkin', 'rate', 'per', 'class', 'new', 'student', 'offer', 'intro', 'deal', 'day', 'practic', 'also', 'offer', 'ton', 'class', 'great', 'option', 'dont', 'want', 'commit', 'one', 'monthth', 'space', 'beauti', 'bit', 'small', 'side', 'fit', 'lot', 'without', 'make', 'feel', 'cramp', 'retail', 'space', 'sell', 'everyth', 'could', 'want', 'mat', 'towel', 'cloth', 'sell', 'snack', 'drink', 'main', 'heat', 'room', 'larg', 'easili', 'accommod', 'mani', 'yogi', 'appreci', 'tape', 'floor', 'show', 'park', 'mat', 'keep', 'everyon', 'line', 'nice', 'grab', 'spot', 'stretch', 'block', 'strap', 'everyon', 'use', 'class', 'usual', 'least', 'one', 'assist', 'walk', 'around', 'adjust', 'form', 'realli', 'feel', 'differ', 'tweak', 'bodi', 'dont', 'worri', 'sweati', 'everyon', 'one', 'care', 'class', 'sweat', 'ive', 'practic', 'mani', 'differ', 'instructor', 'definit', 'favorit', 'would', 'seek', 'class', 'specif', 'easi', 'websit', 'consid', 'take', 'week', 'foundat', 'cours', 'itll', 'realli', 'help', 'practic', 'studio', 'tuck', 'back', 'park', 'lot', 'look', 'bistro', 'la', 'bon', 'famili', 'dollar', 'park', 'never', 'problem', 'class', 'crowd', 'other', 'alway', 'felt', 'like', 'enough', 'space', 'bathroom', 'small', 'chang', 'room', 'hall', 'front', 'use', 'chang', 'leav', 'stall', 'open', 'well', 'hydrat', 'yogi']

One of those cravings are arepas from the Quiero Arepas food truck. If you ever find yourself in Denver, make sure you track them down! So, I found Arepas Grill (thanks, Yelp!) and I headed down to check them out. Just a note... The street address on Yelp is wrong. It is located at 4740 Old Pineville Rd #A. Right next to it's sister restaurant, Colombian Bakery. I walked in and the place was empty. No seriously, there weren't any employees... I waited for a solid three minutes until someone showed up to help me out. Which was fine, as it gave me time to look over the menu. I decided on the Carne Mechada arepa ($6.00) and maracuya (passion fruit) drink ($3.00). He took my order and disappeared to the back. He reappeared a bit later with a freshly made arepa. He proceeded to cut it open and stuff it with the shredded beef and cheese. I asked for the spicy, avocado sauce that I am accustomed to having my arepa served with. The passion fruit drink was awesome! Very fresh tasting and refreshing. I'm on the fence about the arepa. I like how fresh the arepa itself was, but I wasn't really impressed with the fillings. It was definitely tasty, but I am used to my arepas being fixed up with more than just meat and cheese. A little more garnish would have put them over the top! This place could definitely earn the fourth, and even fifth, star easily with a little bit of improvement. They should take a look at Quiero Arepas menu! I would be psyched if they added something like the La Havana to their menu! I'll visit Arepas Grill next time an arepa craving strikes!	3	1	2	['sinc', 'move', 'charlott', 'hunt', 'find', 'place', 'satisfi', 'random', 'crave', 'denver', 'stapl', 'one', 'crave', 'arepa', 'quiero', 'arepa', 'food', 'truck', 'ever', 'find', 'denver', 'make', 'sure', 'track', 'found', 'arepa', 'grill', 'thank', 'yelp', 'head', 'check', 'note', 'street', 'address', 'yelp', 'wrong', 'locat', 'old', 'pinevil', 'rd', 'right', 'next', 'sister', 'restaur', 'colombian', 'bakeri', 'walk', 'place', 'empti', 'serious', 'werent', 'employe', 'wait', 'solid', 'three', 'minut', 'someon', 'show', 'help', 'fine', 'gave', 'time', 'look', 'menu', 'decid', 'carn', 'mechada', 'arepa', 'maracuya', 'passion', 'fruit', 'drink', 'took', 'order', 'disappear', 'back', 'reappear', 'bit', 'later', 'freshli', 'made', 'arepa', 'proceed', 'cut', 'open', 'stuff', 'shred', 'beef', 'chees', 'ask', 'spici', 'avocado', 'sauc', 'accustom', 'arepa', 'serv', 'passion', 'fruit', 'drink', 'awesom', 'fresh', 'tast', 'refresh', 'im', 'fenc', 'arepa', 'like', 'fresh', 'arepa', 'wasnt', 'realli', 'impress', 'fill', 'definit', 'tasti', 'use', 'arepa', 'fix', 'meat', 'chees', 'littl', 'garnish', 'would', 'put', 'top', 'place', 'could', 'definit', 'earn', 'fourth', 'even', 'fifth', 'star', 'easili', 'littl', 'bit', 'improv', 'take', 'look', 'quiero', 'arepa', 'menu', 'would', 'psych', 'ad', 'someth', 'like', 'la', 'havana', 'menu', 'ill', 'visit', 'arepa', 'grill', 'next', 'time', 'arepa', 'crave', 'strike']
